By the invitation of [Dr. Ray Zilinskas](http://www.miis.edu/academics/faculty/rzilinskas), I spoke at a departmental seminar at the [Middlebury Institute of International Studies](http://www.miis.edu/) today, where I presented my research on the impacts of recent technological advances on the biosecurity landscape. I was the first undergraduate to ever be invited and to speak at such a seminar at MIIS, a graduate-only institution.

> Scholars claim that recent technology advances mean that even teenagers can make bioweapons. While this is theoretically possible, it is also very unlikely. Mr. Liu presents a plausible pathway for amateur biohackers to engineer a weapon and assess the difficulty of every step. Furthermore, he comments on how improvements in DNA editing may alter the biosecurity landscape.
