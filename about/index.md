I'm a [Master of Translational Medicine](http://uctranslationalmedicine.org/) candidate at the UC Berkeley College of Engineering and the UC San Francisco School of Medicine.  I'm interested in applying my interdisciplinary training to a career in innovation in biotechnology and biomedicine.

In May 2016, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in [Bioengineering](http://bioeng.berkeley.edu) from the University of California, Berkeley, with High Honors, and a Minor's Certificate from the [Goldman School of Public Policy](http://gspp.berkeley.edu). My academic interests include biodesign, synthetic biology, and biosecurity; and my research and design experience in biofuels, bioweapon defense, and drug-eluting contact lenses span many of these fields. 

I am also active in engineering student organizations. Through my leadership roles in the [Bioengineering Honor Society](http://bioehs.berkeley.edu) and [Tau Beta Pi](https://tbp.berkeley.edu), I've spearheaded projects in educational outreach, networking, cultural awareness, and bridging the gap between STEM and the Humanities.

In my spare time, I follow both American and international politics, and am a menswear, fountain pen, and coffee enthusiast. I'm always looking for new opportunities, discussions on current affairs, and to give (often unwarranted) style advice. Welcome to my site!
