	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Recently I bought myself some <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/platinum-preppy-highlighters/c/288">Platinum Preppy highlighters</a>. Instead of using the free ink cartridges that came with the pen, I eyedroppered them with the matching <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/bottled-ink/c/14/?sortBy=productName%2Basc&amp;facetValueFilter=Tenant~Brand%3Anoodlers%2CTenant~Ink_Color%3Ahighlighter">highlighter inks from Noodlers</a>.</p>

<p>Pretty much, these pens are a hybrid of markers and fountain pens, since it sports the latter’s capillary action ink mechanism and the former’s easy-to-use tip. Filled with water-based yet fluorescent ink, it works quite well, easily drawing emphasis on written documents upon every streak.</p>

<p>The drawback of these highlighters, however, is that it’s quite “wet,” and that the ink can sometimes take awhile to dry atop the page. These properties, desired by users of fountain pens, might not be as useful for highlighters. I’ve had many instances where a too-slow stream with the highlighter not only bled through the back of a page, but stayed on the page long enough to stain the back of the previous page too.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m satisfied with the Platinum Preppy highlighter. Fountain pen fans should consider getting one to complete their entire fountain pen experience!</p>

	  <title>Cabinet Reshuffles</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>When I was President of the Bioengineering Honor Society, I remember wishing for the power to “reshuffle cabinet.” This is a common practice amongst heads of government, such as prime ministers in parliamentary democracies and the President of the United States.</p>

<p>The idea is simple – the President or PM has the power to assign people in his cabinet to new official positions. This could be used to promote political allies or demote political rivals (which is probably the most common reason for reshuffles), or simply to optimize the governmental utility, putting the people with the most expertise or interest in each area in the positions that have influence on them. In a student group, this can work similarly – the President, or some constitutionally determined “executive,” can “move” officers around between positions. This can be appealing for two reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that new club members don’t always run for and get truly fitting positions; as these new officers get to know the club more, they may discover other roles which are more “appropriate” for their interests and talents, and a cabinet reshuffle allows them to enter that more appropriate portfolio instead of being “stuck” in their current one, without having to wait months for another election.</p>

<p>The second reason has to do with time – many officers discover halfway through their term that they are too busy with their schoolwork to perform their expected tasks. A cabinet reshuffle, in this case, can allow busy officers and less-busy officers to swap positions, allowing both to remain a part of the club while allowing work to get done.</p>

<p>There are, of course, counterarguments to implementing reshuffling. While promotions from favoritism may be a concern, I argue that it will likely be less prevalent than in government. Being offered some club title and, in conjunction, all the responsibilities associated with it, is not nearly as attractive as being offered the position of being third-in-line to the Presidency, and the social backlash will be high.</p>

<p>Another potential drawback of reshuffling is that members may not be as willing to become an officer if they don’t have the guarantee of being able to stay. Admittedly, some people are more driven by a position profile than the club when they run to be an officer (e.g. running to be an industrial relations position to get recruiter contacts, without much regard for the actual club). However, if an officer were so interested in their work, they should do well in it, and thus not need to be “reshuffled” to another position. So, this concern should be minimal as well.</p>

<p>Student clubs need flexibility among their personnel. More clubs should consider allowing their officers to move around – through cabinet reshuffles.</p>

	  <title>The Tieless Suit</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><em>Presidents Xi of China and Obama of the United States met yesterday at the Sunnylands Estate in California. The dress code of the event was “no ties,” to emphasize the casual and friendly nature of the talks, but both leaders still chose to wear conservative solid navy suits and white shirts. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)</em></p>

<p>Wearing a suit without a tie can cause controversy. Proponents of the look call it “executive casual,” referring to the ensembles preferred by company executives who do not need to conform to a dress code, but still wish to look elevated. Critics, however, dub the look “the Ahmadinejad,” referring to the unpopular former Iranian President, whose country forbids the wearing of a tie due to the garment’s implications of Western oppression.</p>

<p>For a long time, I was not a huge fan of wearing a suit without a tie. After all, it makes no sense why anyone would bother putting on matching jackets and trousers if he considers tie as too inconvenient. Aesthetically, though, there’s really no reason why a sport jacket and odd trousers could be worn tieless and a suit cannot. So, lately, I’ve been finding myself doing the exact same thing that I attacked viciously just years ago - putting on a suit, checkered shirt, and a brightly-colored pocket square, but leaving the tie at home.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-wear-ties-anyways">Why Do We Wear Ties Anyways?</h3>
<p>To remove a tie from an ensemble, it is first important to understand the purpose of a necktie. In addition to filling up the space below one’s neck and above the lapel, the necktie also serves to add color, slim the body, and provide so-called “balance” to the ensemble by “tying an ensemble together.”</p>

<p>For example, if I were to wear a navy suit and a white shirt, wearing a tie of another color would reduce the starkness of the contrast between the two colors, making the ensemble more pleasant-looking. Even a navy tie can serve to enhance the ensemble, for it will reduce the amount of white color displayed to reduce the amount of contrast seen.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-the-tie-at-home">Leaving the Tie At Home</h3>

<p>To accomplish the “executive casual” look, one should consider toning down the contrast between suit and shirt to trivialize the tie’s purpose of “tying together an ensemble.” One can do so by wearing a lighter colored suit (e.g. light gray and tan) or wearing a darker-colored and/or patterned shirt (solid white bad!). Also, one should consider choosing a suit with little “tie space” (higher buttoning point) to begin with, such as a more modern two-button or a three-button-roll. Note that though double-breasted and three-button suits tend to have smaller tie spaces, the suits tend to be more formal, and thus unsuitable for executive <em>casual</em>.</p>

<p>Some stylists suggested against the button-down collar for this look because the colloar is inherently casual and not sufficiently <em>executive</em> for “executive casual.” Instead, they would recommend a spread collar, which can stand upright without a tie and has uppity implications.</p>

<p>Stylists also warned against pinstripe suits due to their so-called formality, but I find no basis for their concerns because the pinstripe suit is not <em>formal</em>, but rather <em>for business</em>. Instead, I think the pinstripe suit is perhaps even ideal for this role - the stripes can both add color and serve a slimming and lengthening effect, both of which are usually the role of a tie. I would also add that the charcoal or dark gray suit should be avoided completely - both colors are too boring and too formal for executive casual.</p>

<p>Don’t forget a pocket square for a finishing touch!</p>

	  <title>How Wide Should Ties Be?</title>
	  <link>//how-wide-should-ties-be</link>

	  <guid>//how-wide-should-ties-be</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Some ties can compete with spaghetti strands with respect of width, while other ties look more like napkins. I’ve seen ties from 1 inch to 5 inches. Ties both extremely wide and extremely narrow look comical when worn by common folk, but somehow, there are people who can magically pull it off.</p>

<p>There are two criteria that determine tie width – body width and lapel width. Those wider in the chest should wear wider ties, while those on the skinnier side should keep to narrower ties. This rule keeps one’s body and clothing within proportion.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-thumb">The Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p><img src="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiewidth_v7.png" alt="Tie width diagram" />
<em>Image from BlackLapel.com</em></p>

<p>But, unless you wear only custom-tailored ties, it will be hard to find ties that suits one’s proportions exactly. Instead, the width of a tie is usually chosen to match the lapel – the widest point of the tie should measure about the same as the widest point of the jacket lapel.</p>

<p>3.25 inches is a common width for lapels on recent suits, and 3.5-4 inches is more common for suits made in the 90s and early 2000s. Most ties on the market today around 3 inches in width, while 3.75 inches was considered standard for older ties.</p>

<h3 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h3>
<p><img src="http://blog.trashness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sorley-knit.jpg" alt="Peak Lapel with Knit Tie" />
<em><a href="http://ethandesu.com/post/21772396846/sorley-knit-and-orazio-peaks">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Peak lapels, with “peaks” pointing up towards the shoulders, can generally be worn with ties a bit narrower than its width, because the viewer’s attention is not directed at the tie. With notch lapels, however, one can err towards wider ties (although narrow ties work too). Even so, keep difference in width between lapel and tie within half an inch, if possible. Any larger width difference creates discord and looks extremely absurd.</p>

<p>Lastly, the composition of a tie also matters in tie width. Ties with “interesting” (read “distracting”) patterns and weaves (such as wool knits, silk knits, and grenadines) need less width to “grab attention.” So, ties with intricate designs, either in fabric or in pattern, are allowed to be narrower than the jacket lapels. For the same reason, smoother, non-catchy ties can be slightly wider without causing too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h3>
<p>I used to be very particular in matching the width of jacket lapels and ties -  I even did a bit of sewing work on some particularly wide (~4 in) ties so I could wear them with slimmer suits, but ultimately, it wasn’t worth it. The visual improvement was minimal, since I was an amateur at sewing, I destroyed the lining on some of the ties I “modified,” resulting on them being unwearable.</p>

<p>If your jacket lapels are within an inch of the width of your tie, you’re probably fine.</p>

<p>A bottle of <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-iroshizuku-kon-peki-50ml-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/PN69212">Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-Peki</a> ink arrived for me today, and I had a friend buy me a bottle of <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-iroshizuku-yama-budo-50ml-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/PN69217">Yama-budo</a> from Japan, which I’ll get soon.</p>

<p>Pilot Iroshizuku inks sell at $35 for a 50mL bottle. The inks come in unique colors and “behave reliably” on many different papers. The bottle itself is intricately designed, with a “well” on the bottom that would fit a fountain pen, allowing the user to refill a pen from even the last drops of ink.</p>

<p>Though I didn’t pay retail price, the fact that I’m moving into this “luxury” category is nonetheless noteworthy. Just a few years ago, when I received a fountain pen as a high school graduation present, I shook my head at ink selections over $10. Back then, even seven dollars for a bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PARKER-Super-Quink-Bottle-S0037460/dp/B004YK4VHA">Parker Quink Black</a>, the cheapest fountain pen ink I could find, felt like too much to pay for stationary, and now I’m willing to pay multiple times as much.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is indicative of something, and I really need to find something less expensive to like…</p>

	  <title>Dimple Your Tie!</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Well, technically, it’s a choice, but really, do dimple your tie.</p>

<p>In ties, a dimple is an indentation of the tie’s fabric formed directly below the knot. It is a common mark of a well-tied tie. The dimple can both complement a symmetrical knot (e.g. half-Windsor, Windsor) and add balance to an asymmetrical knot (e.g. the four-in-hand).</p>

<p>I dimple all my ties. It’s not particularly hard, especially when I use a thicker tie (e.g. wool, silk knits) or one over 3 inches wide. In the last step of forming the knot before tightening, I pinch the side of the tie with my thumb and middle finger while pressing down on the center with my index finger. The dimple forms, as a result, wherever the index finger presses.</p>

<p>Many well-dressed individuals wear their ties with a dimple, but a dimple is by no means a definitive feature of a well-tied tie. A dimple is nice, but it shouldn’t be forced. On skinny ties, a dimple is difficult or impossible to create simply because there isn’t sufficient fabric in the tie to provide for one. Also, dimples are often hard to maintain on thinner, softer fabrics. If you’re wearing one of those ties, and you cannot form a dimple by pressing on the middle of the tie below the knot, don’t “force” it by over-tightening the knot. The dimple is meant to be a natural occurrence, at best created with a little guidance. If your tie really doesn’t want to dimple, it probably was never meant to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>For the same reason, don’t worry too much about the number of dimples or its (their) location(s). Unless you’re using a half-Windsor or Windsor knot, both of which demand centered, symmetrical dimples, the location of the dimple doesn’t really matter. A dimple of any kind will be sufficient to give “balance” to the ensemble.</p>

	  <title>My First Fountain Pen</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Sometime in elementary school (for me, it was second grade), every Chinese kid would need to switch from writing with pencil to writing with a fountain pen - in every class. In addition to teaching us to write neatly, writing with a fountain pen was supposed to instill in us the value of doing things correctly the first time around. After all, ink, unlike graphite, was permanent, and showed our mistakes. So, if crossed-out sections or evidence of mysteriously ripped-out pages were found in our noteboks, we would be called up to the front of the class and berated for all to see.</p>

<p>Like any other eight-year-old having barely two years of handwriting experience, I dreaded writing with a fountain pen. Unlike the tip of a pencil, which writes in all directions, the fountain pen’s nib only put down ink properly at one angle. Furthermore, clumsy as I was, every night’s pen-refilling ritual left my hands dyed in blue. So, when we were given the opportunity to begin using gel pens (liquid ink, writes in all directions) halfway through third grade, I eagerly made the switch. I never thought I would ever voluntarily pick up a fountain pen again.</p>

<p>So, finding my old fountain pen from elementary schook during my trip to China was an strange yet interesting experience. I’m sure that eight-year-old Zian would never have imagined that thirteen years later, he had somehow become a fountain pen enthusiast, and own way too many bottles of ink and an unreasonable number of pens, but still feeling that he needed more. There was also a sense of nostalgia - coming back after finishing college and at the verge of graduate school, and seeing the equipment that helped me begin my academic journey all those years ago.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the child-sized pen no longer feels comfortable in my hands, and years of disuse has left it clogged with ink. Like many Hero fountain pens made in that era, it also now has a cracked section, which is now unable to attach to the barrel, and the cap no longer closes tightly.</p>

<p>But let it, in its own, particular way, serve as a memento for reflection and introspection for years to come.</p>

	     <p><em>I wrote this essay in the beginning of my Freshman year of college. Now that I’m about to graduate, I’m posting this again for reflections.</em></p>

<p>It was 4:10 PM, on 26 February 2012, and in many respects, the day was just like any other day in Albany, California. The sky, as often is in late February, was clear, though the season of rain was within weeks of approaching. The street, commonly with only few cars on weekends, seems even emptier, for most residents have decided to retreat to their homes to watch the Academy Awards. The sun is setting, and the earth is quiet, save for the chirping of a few birds that have refused to migrate for the winter. My ride was late, and I was forced to walk to the community center alone.</p>

<p>I was dressed slightly more formal than usual – a dark gray overcoat, a navy pinstripe suit, a white dress shirt, a white pocket square neatly folded to show three corners, and a red tie with white and blue stripes tied in a symmetrical full Windsor knot – not exactly the correct attire for carrying two large stacked crates. One of the crates contained the official laptop of the Game Designing Club – a rusty Dell Latitude prone to blue screens – a camera, and a video camera. The other contained gifts for the banquet guests – 36 yellow bags, 36 packages of gummy bears, 36 candy bars, 36 handwritten thank-you notes, 36 thank-you pens, and 36 copies of my just-completed computer game – <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em>.</p>

<p>I began <em>Legend of the Dragon Master</em> as an eighth grader at Albany Middle School. I was free back then – lonely, in fact. I had long established my reputation as the class pariah through many years of being “weird,” and, expectedly, I had no friends. Instead, as I ate lunch alone every day in the corner of the blacktop, many came by to point at the “crazy genius,” whispering and giggling to their friends, wondering just what species I actually belonged to, since I definitely wasn’t human enough to fit in with them.</p>

<p>As I tore open the wrapping of the same sandwich in the same corner of the same blacktop, I wondered how I could change myself to be the same as my peers – how I could finally find someone to eat with during lunch. Yet, what seemed an easy task for most individuals was not simple to me. Through many years of isolation and confusion, I have established a reputation of being an aloof, eccentric, and outright weird child. My peers did not want to approach me, fearing that they’d become associated with the school’s outcast, and somehow become “uncool” as a result. Realizing that isolation would not help me in future years of schooling, I longed for friends – even just peers with whom I could chat and perhaps even have lunch. I longed for a moment that can reintroduce me to my teachers and classmates, convincing them that I am not insane – that I am one of them.</p>

<p>Through random searches on the internet performed during my long, boring, and friendless after-school hours, I discovered <em>Legend of Cao Cao</em>, an old Chinese game commonly modified by designers to create brand new productions. I was immediately interested. Having an immense interest within Chinese history and some experience with simple programming, I wanted to create my own game. It would be set in a futuristic environment oddly similar to that of Ancient China. The storyline would be based on a conflict between two forces: over time, the “just” force of the main character – I – would succeed in defeating the “evil” opposition and become a benevolent ruler of the world. As a creative twist, instead of taking figures from history, I planned to name characters after my classmates and teachers. To fit in with the theme of the game, characters would resemble warriors from medieval China, but would have characteristics exclusive of the people upon whom they were based. Yet, to realize my idea, I needed to do more than plan; I must start approaching others and tell them about my idea. With luck, they’d agree to be characters in my game. With luck, they’d be convinced that I’d be normal. With luck, they’d be my friend. With luck, they’d let me join them at lunch. With luck, <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> began.</p>

<p>Honks from a nearby car broke my daydream of remembering the beginnings of the production. I was one block away from the community center, and my friend Daniel, who had intended to drive me and my crates to the banquet site, had finally caught up with me. After a hastily mumbled excuse, he opened the door and let me in. 30 seconds later, we stopped before the building where my five-year journey with <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> will finally come to a close.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Daniel and I weren’t the first to arrive at the community center. Richard, the production’s coding director, had already waited there for ten minutes. With a tripod slung over his left shoulder, he complained about Daniel’s and my tardiness, and stated that he was always the first one to show up at any Design Team meeting. In fact, he was the first person to notice and support my creation of <em>Legend of the Dragon Master</em> back in the eighth grade. Sitting across from me in Spanish class one day, Richard found his desk flooded with papers overflowing from an almost-toppled stack on my desk. Slightly annoyed, he picked a few up and tossed them over the invisible border between the two desks. “What the hell is this anyways?” He glanced at the cover of the overflowing folder. “Wait, you’re making a game?”</p>

<p>I tried to hide the document. I had not intended for anyone to know about my project yet. The ideas had not yet been fully developed. Everything was still a draft. Wanting the game to be a testament of my sanity, I feared that telling others about my novel ideas before their full development would effectively sabotage my goals. However, to Richard’s urging, I gave in and explained my plans. I expected him to mock my unorthodox ideas, but instead, he expressed interest in blending ancient China with modern society.  He said, “Let me help.” He became my first supporter and his integration in society attracted more peers to the game. In the next months, Spanish class was no longer awkwardly quiet, but instead, it was filled with sounds of Richard and I both working to recruit more characters and add more events to the storyline. “Put Mr. DeWall into your game!” he once suggested. “Add some scene in which he sings his song ‘No Puedo Dormir’ and gives all the enemies insomnia!” Our Spanish teacher was thus recruited as a character in the game, and in a month, half of our Spanish class had already been recruited into the game as characters, and the game became well-known across the school. My reputation improved and <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> was on the rise.</p>

<p>Daniel again awoke me from my imaginations, slapping his wrangled necktie in my face. He had a tendency to do that – reminding me of reality when my ideas become too abstract. As my associate producer, he was my most trusted adviser in the creation of the game. We began to speak a few months after the game became known to the public. I had stopped eating lunch in the corner of the blacktop, and instead had moved into classrooms – I took advantage of the computers there to perform the research needed to complete my game. By coincidence, Daniel was there one day, and we chatted randomly about swords in ancient combat as we chewed our sandwiches. To show him a Chinese sword, I turned on the computer and opened <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em>, and he was immediately drawn – not to the scaly bitmap of the sword, but to my wish to create my own RPG. “Let me help you!” he offered enthusiastically, extending his hand. “I can help you test it, make it – do whatever you want.” As the production had grown to include a sizeable number of characters, I offered my hand as well, completing the handshake and accepting Daniel as my second co-worker.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, Daniel spent his Computer Science classes playing the game, and though the teacher did not quite appreciate it, I certainly did. Every day, Daniel would complete the levels that I had programmed, report bugs, and pester me for more stages to test. Now accompanied by an enthusiastic co-worker, I found myself working more efficiently. In four months, twenty stages of <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> had been completed. A month after that, we made the first custom <em>Legend of Cao Cao</em> engine in English. Internet critics were stunned. They proclaimed it “the Dragon’s Miracle,” crediting me with the incredible feat, but, in reality, it was Daniel’s constant encouragement that had powered me to success, and ultimately, allowed me to host the celebration banquet of that day.</p>

<p>Shing– the music director– arrived next, and I was to go with her to the caterer and pick up our food. As she drove, I began to think of the night’s agenda. The banquet would begin with the arrival of guests, and proceed with a welcoming speech by Daniel. Then, accompanied by the men who helped me begin the production, I would formally announce that <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> was completed and released. Later, with numerous excessive formalities, I would thank the guests one-by-one for their help, and, ultimately, dedicate the game to a surprise guest and allow the guests to enjoy the rest of their meal without the sound of my voice droning on.</p>

<p>Shing had no idea that she was the surprise guest and dedicatee of my game, though it was not hard to predict that she would be on the top of my pick list. As the music director, she switched the collection of Chinese songs originally on the game soundtrack with a group of relevant songs in English – so that gamers could actually understand and enjoy the contents of the background music, rather than putting their computers on mute to avoid the ear-piercing screeches of a Chinese opera singer. In addition to her many contributions to the production, Shing had been a sister to me as well. Years ago, during English group projects, the oddly-numbered class would divide cleanly in two – with me as the lone remainder. At these moments, Shing would willingly take me into her group. Unlike my previous experiences with group projects, in which I would do all the work while other group members sat around and chatted, projects with Shing were always enjoyable. I never had to sit around and listen awkwardly to conversations in which I could not participate, for Shing worked to include me in group chats. Though I sometimes had trouble understanding references to popular shows, Shing would connect the conversation to a subject that I had an interest in. Later, she showed me Google Talk and Google Voice – two methods of keeping in touch with my newfound friends, finally allowing me to walk through the school as an integral part of society.</p>

<p>As I carried boxes of fried rice and chow-mein to the car, I continued to think about my change from the past years. As we drove back to the community center, I began to consider the speech – designed to be mostly impromptu – that I was about to give that night. Merely five years prior, I was a kid whom no person in his right mind wanted to approach. I was awkward and detached from society – though with high academic intellect, I had nearly no social ability. My partners in producing <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em> taught me differently. By paying attention to my plans, Richard told me that I had a thread of sanity. Through my work with Daniel, I grew confident in both myself and others’ willingness to accept me. With Shing’s help, I became integrated in the society around me, finally becoming that member of community that I had often longed to be. Others, too, aided me in my progress: there was Mr. Pressnall and the permission to be different, Profe and the ability to be liked, Nir and the process of self-presentation, Juneyoung and work efficiency, etc. etc. etc. Memories filled my mind as I walked to the lectern. Turning at the toe mark, I took a deep breath and looked ahead directly at the camera. Before me, 36 guests sat with plates of food before them. They were waiting for the signal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor and responsibility as Chairman of the Dragon’s Fury Game Series Design Team to announce the final release of <em>Dragon’s Fury: Legend of the Dragon Master</em>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A thunderous applause filled the room, but only the youngest of children touched their forks, only to be quickly told to put them down by the parents. The guests were waiting for me, and I understood. I wrapped up my speech quickly and concluded with the game’s dedication to Shing and soon joined the guests as they began their long-awaited meal. As plastic utensils moved rapidly above plates of food and plastic cups came together in toasts, many guests were celebrating different things.</p>

<p>Some celebrated the end of a five-year project.</p>

<p>Others cheered at the realization of a seemingly impossible goal.</p>

<p>The kids liked that the old-looking-young-guy in the suit finally stopped talking and their parents finally let them start stuffing their food.</p>

<p>Yet, I celebrated a different change – simpler, more obvious:</p>

<p><strong>I celebrated that I no longer ate alone.</strong></p>

	     <p>My undergraduate biodesign team, Team ForSight, was invited to participate in the <a href="http://www.rice360.rice.edu/#!design-competition/wv2xp">Rice 360° Sixth Annual Undergraduate Global Health Technologies Design Competition</a>. My team mates, Amanda and Ian, and I presented our design for a drug-eluting contact lens targeted for use in developing countries, to deliver antifungal drug natamycin to treat corneal ulcers.</p>

<p>There, we also received feedback from industry and clinical experts on ways to improve our product design to increase its usability both in a developing world setting.</p>

<p>Here is an abstract of our presentation to Rice 360:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corneal ulceration is a leading cause of preventable blindness in the developing world, where the cost of treatment and the lack of accessible medical facilities pose barriers to administering care.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have designed a proof-of-concept prototype for a novel drug eluting contact lens, which delivers drugs directly to the cornea. The design consists of a layer of PDMS, a soft, biocompatible polymer, to keep the contact’s shape, and a layer of biodegradable PLGA, which contains the drug in suspension.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using natamycin, the only FDA-approved ocular antifungal drug, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our contact design to clear yeast in agar diffusion tests. We also showed that our degradation design delivers drug more efficiently and in a more sustained fashion than both eyedrops and a diffusion limited model. Our contact lens prototype provides a proof of concept for a low-cost, easy-to-use ocular drug delivery device.</p>
