            <p>President Obama wears a uniform of dark blue or charcoal suits with white or light blue medium-spread barrel cuff shirts and darker ties. The suits are mostly well-cut from Hart Schaffner Marx, a traditional American clothier, but they still look off-the-rack. Overall, President Obama looks just like another businessman – conservative and better than many of his poorly-dressed colleagues in Washington, but nothing special.</p>

<p>Bush 43 wore custom suits from Oxxford, a very traditional and high-range American tailor. Like the incumbent President, Bush II looked very conservative with his wardrobe of point-collar shirts and patterned ties, but was not exactly “exceptional” in any way.</p>

<p>Number 42, Bill Clinton, was a victim of his times, and fairly poorly-dressed. As reported from the New York Times, his suits were loose-cut to provide comfort, and had wide and low lapels and a low buttoning-point. The suits fit with Clinton’s personality, but also looked extremely sloppy. In fact, since the President liked his suits ventless, he often looked as if he was wearing a flour sack. Clinton’s point-collar shirts and loud ties did not help correct this sloppy image.</p>

<p>Since leaving office, President Clinton seems to have changed his style to be the exact opposite of that during his Presidency. Now, Clinton wears very well-tailored three-button (and often three-piece) European suits, complete with a very wide spread collar and a bright-colored tie knotted in a large half-Windsor. Formerly sloppy and humble, the former President now looks neat but also extremely elitist.</p>

<p>George H.W. Bush seems to be the last president to actually dress well.</p>

<p>Bush I’s style seems to have been inspired by his early days at Yale. He embodied the Ivy League look. His suits, always well-fit, were bought from J. Press, a menswear company founded on the Yale campus, and were distinctive for their three-roll-two structure (although the suit had three buttons, the top button was meant to be only decorative and mostly hidden). His shirts had point-collars and double cuffs – another reflection of his Yale heritage – and his ties were distinctively American. More importantly, the elder President Bush often wore a white linen pocket square – a great finishing touch to the already spectacular ensemble.</p>

<p>Most importantly, President George H.W. Bush was distinct from his time. At a time when lapels and ties were wide to “project power,” President Bush wore slim. Despite President Reagan’s full Windsor knots were popular, Bush always sported the traditional four-in-hand. In the late 80s and early 90s, when all aspects of menswear turned to favor power, the 41st President of the United States never shifted much from his Ivy Leagues – a dedication to timeless style.</p>

Now that his career in politics is over, the former President is still embodying Ivy League style, but with more display of personal taste. Look at his brightly-colored socks – a subtle yet effective way to personalize an otherwise conservative ensemble.</p>

<p>George H.W. Bush was the last well-dressed President of the United States.</p>
