	     <p>I am honored and humbled to assume the Office of President of the Bioengineering Honor Society. For myself and on behalf of this club, I want to thank my predecessor for all she has done.</p>

<p>I want to recognize Anita for her role in the leadership, because she, not I, should have been the one becoming president today. Anita, youâ€™ve given so much to this club - joy in a year as Social Chair and direction in a semester as EVP. We relied on you for each and every important project - two DWPs, the high school competition, a plethora of workshops, and countless socials. Your enthusiasm, your dependability, your natural and proven leadership - all these qualities made you the rock and backbone of BioEHS in this difficult time. I hope to be a worthy replacement of the great president you surely would have been.</p>

<p>For all of BioEHS - alumni, officers, members old and new - I want to apologize if this club has not lived up to your expectations. BioEHS needs to change after a year of stagnation, and it is the responsibility of this officer core to give the club the activation energy needed to revive it.</p>

<p>For we must make candidacy worthwhile to those who wish to join us, we must make membership meaningful for those who are a part of us, and we must make our actions useful for those around us.</p>

<p>My fellow bioengineers, fellow members of the Bioengineering Honor Society - the era of stagnation is over. Because today, the work to build a better BioEHS begins, and I hope to see all of you on the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Thank you, and good night!</p>
