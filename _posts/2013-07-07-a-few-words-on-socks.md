I’m not an expert on socks, but I know enough to not wear white athletic socks with my suits and black dress shoes. I even know not to wear black dress socks unless I’m wearing black trousers (which is a rare occurrence in the first place). Instead, a man’s dress socks should help connect one’s clothing to his shoes.

The often simplest interpretation of this rule is to wear socks in the same exact color as one’s trousers. This way, one’s trousers will effectively extend to literally “connect” with the shoes. This is standard procedure in menswear. Especially clear when worn with suits, this method continues the flow of one’s clothing from head to toe. Additionally, “lengthening” the trouser will also make one’s legs look longer, increasing the perceived height of the individual.

Another interpretation of the rule reads that the color of the socks should be somewhere in between that of the trousers and that of the shoes. This rule is used more often when lighter-colored trousers are worn with darker shoes, or vice versa. In those cases, matching the socks and trousers isn’t enough to connect the shoes and clothing, and instead a “progression” of different tones is needed. For example, wearing a light gray suit with black shoes will look better with medium-gray socks than either light gray or black.

The final “interpretation” of the socks rule draws another color from clothing from the upper body and either matches it entirely or complements it – similar to how one might wear a pocket square. This is seen as a subtle way to display stylistic enlightenment, and, especially in cases of complementation, should only be left to those spiritually enlightened, for a lapse in judgment may result in monstrosities similar to wearing black pants with white socks. Safe ways to implement the non-trouser-related method of choosing socks involves matching the jacket (when a contrasting sport coat is worn), such as wearing navy socks with a navy blazer, despite tan-colored khakis.

When a man dresses for non-athletic events, he should either show his full ankle or none at all – anything else is considered bad taste, if not somewhat disgusting. So, with respect to length – one should wear socks in the “over-the-calf” length. They minimize the chance that one’s ankles will ever show. Wool and cotton, with a dash of spandex and other elastic materials, are the most common materials for dress socks. I expect woolen socks to be warmer than cotton ones, but feel free to experiment and see for yourself.

As for white socks – they are acceptable, somewhat, in non-athletic menswear. If the overall ensemble is sufficiently light/bright in color (the trousers would ideally have a bit of white in them) and the shoes worn are not black, white dress socks (as in those made in silk, luxury cotton, etc.; not the elastic ones one wears with running shoes) may seem acceptable for the occasion. However, if you’re reading this blog, you probably should leave such experimentation to others more experienced in socks.
