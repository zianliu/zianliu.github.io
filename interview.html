        <section class="post-content">
            
            <p>It’s interview season for me, which means that for the first time in a while, I’ll be wearing a suit by necessity, not by choice. Certainly, dressing up frequently implies that I’ll probably be more comfortable with this “elevated formality” when compared to most of my peers, “interview attire” still is a little different from my personal style.</p>

<p>When I wear a suit for an event, I tend to pay attention only to coordination between different garments. This, when done with a general preference for subtle patterns and high contrast usually would yield very British-inspired ensembles – quiet suits and ties, patterned shirts, and an bright-colored pocket square. With respect to shoes, I alternate between pairs of longwing brogues in different shades of burgundy and brown. They not only provide a sense of sophistication, but also are easy to find well-cared-for, vintage, and affordable on eBay.</p>

<p>If I were to show up in these ensembles for an interview, I doubt I’ll raise any eyebrows (maybe if I wear my signature hot pink pocket square, it might be another story…). Even so, I still tend to err even more conservative, following the tried-and-true mantra of “two solids and a stripe.”</p>

<p>This, coupled with conservative business colors, only yields a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A worsted woolen suit in solid navy or dark/charcoal gray.</li>
  <li>A cotton shirt in solid white or light blue</li>
  <li>A silk tie in burgundy or a shade of blue, with stripes (or some other small, conservative pattern)</li>
  <li>Black leather belt and shoes, preferably oxfords</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Yes – if you have the luxury of having a wardrobe that has all these pieces, or the time and resources to buy or borrow them, but I’ve learned that most of my peers do not. How does one, then, make do with the pieces you have?</p>

<h3 id="suit">Suit</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest limiting factor. Solid blue or gray suits are ideal, but I find that a lot of my friends would instead own black suits (a cardinal sin in men’s business dress, mind you – read my first blog article), or some multi-striped monstrosity on sale at Men’s Wearhouse. My judgment aside, wear the darkest, least-patterned suit you have. If you must choose between a solid black suit and some multi-stripe with a more conservative color, go with the solid black – you can likely pass it off as navy or charcoal on a cursory glance.</p>

<h3 id="shirt">Shirt</h3>
<p>You really should have a solid white shirt and a solid light blue shirt. In addition to that, for interviews, you’d want a shirt that is well-fitting, has either a point or moderately-spread collar, and uses barrel cuffs. If this is not available, a button-down or wider spread collar should also work, but I’d avoid any shirts that has French cuffs – they might be seen as a “power play” garment. If you don’t have a “solid color” shirt, wear the one you have with the lightest background (preferably white) and least amount of patterns (no more than one additional color, in a simple stripe or checkered pattern).</p>

<p>Oh, another addition – I recommend against wearing a blue shirt against a black suit – the contrast just doesn’t look right. Blue suit and gray suits are, on the other hand, will be far more “forgiving.”</p>

<h3 id="tie">Tie</h3>
<p>Probably the most flexible part of this ensemble, but nonetheless still limited by the need to remain simple and “business-like.” A blue somewhere between royal and navy or a darker shade of red or burgundy works best, and I would find one with a small repeating pattern (pin-dots work well) or stripe, and stick away from solids because they are a tad “too” boring. A gray tie could work, but lighter shades or “silvers” might make you seem like you’re going to a wedding rather than an interview. Follow the rules on pattern sizing if any of your other garments are also patterned (match different patterns and vary like patterns).</p>

<p>I would be cautious, though, on wearing colors that are too “flashy” – that’s the bright reds, purples… anything that you would find on POTUS 45. On a similar note, stay away from shiny ties – a bit of sheen is good, but for interviews, you’d want to look more like POTUS 44 than the current one.</p>

<h3 id="shoes-and-socks">Shoes and Socks</h3>
<p>Nothing much to say here – wear black leather dress shoes and a matching leather belt. If you don’t have that, wear your darkest leather shoes or sneakers, and hope that your interviewer doesn’t look down. Your socks should match your pants, and if that doesn’t work, your shoes, and your ankle should be covered always. At no time is it appropriate it wear white, athletic socks, to a business formal interview…</p>

<p>If you have the luxury of choose, or are in the process of buying shoes, consider the following. Lace-up styles are better than slip-on loafers, and closed lacing systems (like Converse, but leather) are seen as more appropriate than open lacing. In addition, choose plain styles over complex patterns (e.g. brogues), and avoid overly square or overly pointy toe styles.</p>

<p><strong>And that’s it! These are all the pieces you’ll need to dress for an interview. Good luck!</strong></p>
