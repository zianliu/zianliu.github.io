The black suit is becoming increasingly popular among men. From President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation to Hollywood starts to peasants on Chinese farmer's markets, the black suit now seems everywhere. In Asia, black has replaced navy blue and charcoal gray as the standard color for men. Even in the Americas, Men's Wearhouse has gone as far as telling customers that the black suit is the "first and only suit" that most men need.

But, is the black suit really that important? In my opinion, no. In fact, I find it pretty much useless compared to those in other colors.

By tradition, darker fabric is considered "more formal" than their lighter alternatives. Black fabric, by this logic, was often reserved for the most formal of clothes - morning coats, tailcoats, strollers, tuxedos, etc. Suits - usually considered business dress - was only cut from black fabric in the occasion of funerals.

Because most men purchase suits for use in business purposes, black suits are impractical because they are seen as "too formal" for the occasion. They will be unable to serve the purpose of interviews and business meetings, and thus are not even considered "business suits."

Black suits aren't much useful for modern formal events either. With a long reputation of being "the funeral suit," black suits often carry a somber connotation. They are unfit for weddings and celebrations - two major social uses of the suit. Moreover, after the popularization of the electric light bulb, black is now no longer "the darkest color" because black fabric often carries a green or yellow tint under artificial lighting. Instead, midnight blue is considered "more formal" and more suitable for evening formals.

In addition to its relative uselessness in business and social affairs, the black suit is fairly hard to complement. In daylight, it creates a contrast so stark with most shirt-and-tie combinations that cannot match most skin tones and hair colors. So, unless one has black hair and pale skin, he should not list the black suit on the top of his wishlist. Black suits are also difficult to match to shirts and ties, for the color black only complements small range of colors. Lastly, many black suits on the market are cut from low-grade fabric. Gentlemen will be better off investing in a suit of navy blue or charcoal gray.

Black suits are nice if one has dark hair, light skin, a navy suit, a charcoal suit, and plans to wear the black suit only to funerals, concerts, and parties. Otherwise, he should really consider a nice suit in blue or gray.
