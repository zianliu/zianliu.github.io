	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>It’s interview season for me, which means that for the first time in a while, I’ll be wearing a suit by necessity, not by choice. Certainly, dressing up frequently implies that I’ll probably be more comfortable with this “elevated formality” when compared to most of my peers, “interview attire” still is a little different from my personal style.</p>

<p>When I wear a suit for an event, I tend to pay attention only to coordination between different garments. This, when done with a general preference for subtle patterns and high contrast usually would yield very British-inspired ensembles – quiet suits and ties, patterned shirts, and an bright-colored pocket square. With respect to shoes, I alternate between pairs of longwing brogues in different shades of burgundy and brown. They not only provide a sense of sophistication, but also are easy to find well-cared-for, vintage, and affordable on eBay.</p>

<p>If I were to show up in these ensembles for an interview, I doubt I’ll raise any eyebrows (maybe if I wear my signature hot pink pocket square, it might be another story…). Even so, I still tend to err even more conservative, following the tried-and-true mantra of “two solids and a stripe.”</p>

<p>This, coupled with conservative business colors, only yields a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A worsted woolen suit in solid navy or dark/charcoal gray.</li>
  <li>A cotton shirt in solid white or light blue</li>
  <li>A silk tie in burgundy or a shade of blue, with stripes (or some other small, conservative pattern)</li>
  <li>Black leather belt and shoes, preferably oxfords</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Yes – if you have the luxury of having a wardrobe that has all these pieces, or the time and resources to buy or borrow them, but I’ve learned that most of my peers do not. How does one, then, make do with the pieces you have?</p>

<h3 id="suit">Suit</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest limiting factor. Solid blue or gray suits are ideal, but I find that a lot of my friends would instead own black suits (a cardinal sin in men’s business dress, mind you – read my first blog article), or some multi-striped monstrosity on sale at Men’s Wearhouse. My judgment aside, wear the darkest, least-patterned suit you have. If you must choose between a solid black suit and some multi-stripe with a more conservative color, go with the solid black – you can likely pass it off as navy or charcoal on a cursory glance.</p>

<h3 id="shirt">Shirt</h3>
<p>You really should have a solid white shirt and a solid light blue shirt. In addition to that, for interviews, you’d want a shirt that is well-fitting, has either a point or moderately-spread collar, and uses barrel cuffs. If this is not available, a button-down or wider spread collar should also work, but I’d avoid any shirts that has French cuffs – they might be seen as a “power play” garment. If you don’t have a “solid color” shirt, wear the one you have with the lightest background (preferably white) and least amount of patterns (no more than one additional color, in a simple stripe or checkered pattern).</p>

<p>Oh, another addition – I recommend against wearing a blue shirt against a black suit – the contrast just doesn’t look right. Blue suit and gray suits are, on the other hand, will be far more “forgiving.”</p>

<h3 id="tie">Tie</h3>
<p>Probably the most flexible part of this ensemble, but nonetheless still limited by the need to remain simple and “business-like.” A blue somewhere between royal and navy or a darker shade of red or burgundy works best, and I would find one with a small repeating pattern (pin-dots work well) or stripe, and stick away from solids because they are a tad “too” boring. A gray tie could work, but lighter shades or “silvers” might make you seem like you’re going to a wedding rather than an interview. Follow the rules on pattern sizing if any of your other garments are also patterned (match different patterns and vary like patterns).</p>

<p>I would be cautious, though, on wearing colors that are too “flashy” – that’s the bright reds, purples… anything that you would find on POTUS 45. On a similar note, stay away from shiny ties – a bit of sheen is good, but for interviews, you’d want to look more like POTUS 44 than the current one.</p>

<h3 id="shoes-and-socks">Shoes and Socks</h3>
<p>Nothing much to say here – wear black leather dress shoes and a matching leather belt. If you don’t have that, wear your darkest leather shoes or sneakers, and hope that your interviewer doesn’t look down. Your socks should match your pants, and if that doesn’t work, your shoes, and your ankle should be covered always. At no time is it appropriate it wear white, athletic socks, to a business formal interview…</p>

<p>If you have the luxury of choose, or are in the process of buying shoes, consider the following. Lace-up styles are better than slip-on loafers, and closed lacing systems (like Converse, but leather) are seen as more appropriate than open lacing. In addition, choose plain styles over complex patterns (e.g. brogues), and avoid overly square or overly pointy toe styles.</p>

<p><strong>And that’s it! These are all the pieces you’ll need to dress for an interview. Good luck!</strong></p>

	  <title>Reconsider the Three-Button Suit</title>
	  <link>//reconsider-3b</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Once upon a time, not too long ago, men were expected to wear three-button suits – it’s just how things were, and in fact, JFK was considered a “radical” for opting for two-buttons during his presidency. Even in recent memory, two-button and three-button jackets were seen at similar frequencies, and considered “equally appropriate” for occasions of the same formality. However, three-button suits are now hard to find. When I visited a Hickey Freeman store last summer, I was surprised to hear that the maker no longer carried ready-to-wear three-button models, and that the style was only available made-to-measure.</p>

<p>Why did this formerly revered style disappear? All other things equal, a two-button suit will probably “more forgiving,” flattering more body types than its three-button equivalent, as well as feeling “less restrictive” when buttoned up. Even so, I still have a soft spot for the three-button style – and not just because I’m a “snowflake millennial from California” who likes to be different. A three-button coat, worn correctly, can work wonders to make a man look taller and slimmer.<br />
<img src="http://icanstyleu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sometimesalwaysnever.jpg" alt="Sometimes, always, never" />
The biggest “mistake” that I see on three-button suit wearers is fastening the buttons improperly – and this is an easy fix. As a reminder, the “rule” for such a suit is “sometimes, always, never,” from the top button down. To this, I propose a revision that the top button on a three-button coat should be closed “almost never.” This way, your three-button jackets looks virtually identical to a two-button, thus getting all its benefits. In addition, the presence of a third button could help you look taller – thank physics for visual illusions!</p>

<p>What, then, is the problem with buttoning both top buttons? On most such jackets, fastening the top button will leave almost no “space” between the lapels to “display” the shirt and tie, making the entire top half of the ensemble seem out of proportion. The lapels themselves will probably seem too short and too wide, all contributing to make the wearer seem short and stout and “misshapen” as well (Michel Anton’s words, not mine).</p>

<p>In what cases, then, can you safely button the top two buttons? This “style” works best on tall, skinny folks – on whom the proportions of a closed three-button suit would seem more reasonable. A suit with a lower top button, thus leaving more room to display the tie, and with narrower lapels, as to better “scale” the rest of the ensemble, would also help make the “top two” buttoning style make sense.
So, with that, go try on some three-button suits! If you could find one, that is.</p>

	  <title>Why I Got Into Suits</title>

	     <p>If you walk through Berkeley, you will probably see more people in hoodies and sweatpants rather than jackets and ties. So, as a menswear enthusiast based in the Bay Area, I frequently get questions about what got me into suits and ties. So, I figured I’d write about this here.</p>

<p>Growing up, I spent a lot of time with my grandpa. As a former high school principal, Grandpa was accustomed to projecting authority through his clothes, and a wardrobe to match. Specifically, I remember he had four separate suits. The first, bought for cheap, was the suit he wore for going shopping to the open-air farmer’s market. The second, slightly more upscale, was for going to supermarkets (i.e. the indoor ones) and picking me up from school. A third suit would be for “general use,” such as photos, greeting guests, and attending social functions. The last suit was reserved for “special occasions only.” A 60th birthday gift from his children, the suit was from China’s then-top-designer and had a sticker price worth a few months of an average man’s salary. When I asked Grandpa to show it to me the last time I was back in Beijing, he informed me that the suit was safely locked away in a suitcase, and will only be brought out “when the occasion is right.”</p>

<p>However, I liked sweats and hated shopping as much as any other kid. It was an eye surgery during high school that finally exposed me to the more “respectable” parts of the menswear spectrum. After the procedure, doctors warned me to avoid pulling garments over the eye. This meant for a month post-surgery, I could only wear button-ups – I was forced to explore what I could do with them, and the habit eventually became stuck. I found that I was beginning to wear collared shirts by choice, rather than simply to protect my eye.</p>

<p>To make things arguably worse, I soon discovered the world of “thrifty menswear,” a community of men who seek treat purchasing menswear with the same attitude some have towards cars – “let someone else absorb the cost of buying new!” After all, quality, well-maintained suits or ties should last for decades. Furthermore, frequent sales and deals could bring the cost of new garments close to that of a “club fundraiser” t-shirt. As a result, my wardrobe grew, and we all know what happened next. Today, I own over 50 ties, write my own fashion blog, and teach workshops telling engineers how to dress for an interview.</p>

<p>Interesting how things go, isn’t it?</p>

	  <title>What Color Tie Should I Wear?</title>
	  <link>//whatcolortie</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Picking a tie can be difficult – they come in so many different colors, not to say different shades within the same color. Even between two ties of the exact same color, the texture of each fabric may come into play in figuring out which tie looks best with the rest of one’s ensemble.</p>

<h3 id="its-all-about-contrast">It’s all about contrast</h3>

<p>The traditional ideology picking color tones/shades is that the suit is darker than the tie, which is in turn darker than the shirt. This rule works, but really shouldn’t be taken that seriously. While “suit darker than shirt” is a tried-and-true rule, the interplay between other garments is more flexible, and can best be summarized as “contrast or exact match.”</p>

<p>This statement might sound a bit confusing at first – if two things either match or contrast, then… what are they? In essence, you should avoid wearing colors that are similar but not the same – for example, a white shirt with a pale-yellow tie or a navy suit with a dark-but-not-yet-navy blue tie. Why is this a problem? Think back to the last time you had to insert figures into PowerPoint. You were using a white template and your figure looked like it had a white background too, but once you overlaid them, you found that the two “whites” were different. Now there was an awkward, faint border around your figure – not contrasting enough to look intentional and just enough to be annoying.</p>

<p>Get the image now? Try to avoid that in what your wear.</p>

<h3 id="fill-in-the-colors">Fill in the colors!</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sessions.edu/wp-content/themes/divi-child/color-calculator/color-wheel.png" alt="A color wheel" />
It’s hard to come up with a definitive rule of what colors work well together and what don’t. Other than the rules that black should mix with neither navy nor brown, most colors will work with each other. (Even navy/brown and black can be worn together tastefully.) You can use color wheel to find the best tie colors to contrast or harmonize with a given jacket or shirt, but let’s be honest – it will take forever.</p>

<p>If you’re lazy, you can wear colors that are known to work: blue and gray, blue and red or orange, purple or pink with navy or black, blue or purple and yellow, brown and tan, etc. An easy way to figure out what “works” is to see what combinations exist in nature – colors found in scenery, on plants, in insects or animals. I admit it might sound weird at first, but just think about it – when was the last time you described nature as “awkward?”</p>

<p>A “more advanced” technique is to have one garment match the secondary color in another garment. What does that mean? If you’re wearing a suit with blue stripes, a tie with the same color as the stripe seems to be a logical next step. The color of your hair or your eyes is another place of “inspiration. For instance, former Vice President Biden was frequently praised by stylists for wearing blue ties that matched the color of his eyes.</p>

<h3 id="want-to-stop-thinking-about-it">Want to stop thinking about it?</h3>
<p>Prefer the Mark Zuckerberg/Steve Jobs aesthetic of wearing essentially the same thing every day? There’s a way to do that with suits too. Solid navy and solid burgundy ties work with pretty much every suit and every shirt, and with that, you now have more time to worry about everything else going on in your life.</p>

	  <title>Is There Such a Thing As Too Much Blue?</title>
	  <link>//toomuchblue</link>

	     <p>I love the color blue - it’s probably my favorite - and I wear it a lot. I own three solid navy suits and three solid navy sportcoats, most of my dress shirts are in shades of blue or are white with blue patterns, a majority of my ties are blue, and of course I have plenty of blue other accessories. Blue is an easy color to incorporate into any business/classic menswear ensemble, but the ensemble I wore to a departmental banquet tonight got me thinking about whether there’s such a thing as “too much blue.”</p>

<p><img src="https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LU083_1218ac_GR_20151218152241.jpg" alt="President Barack Obama" title="Obama in Tonal Ensemble" /></p>

<p>My ensemble wasn’t all that uncommon - navy suit, medium blue shirt, and navy dotted tie. In fact, President Obama has been wearing darker shirts in his blue-on-blue ensembles recently, creating an overall “tonal” look, but this doesn’t seem to work quite as well on me. I subscribe to the Alan Flusser’s school of thought that the contrast within a person’s clothing should seek to complement their natural contrast, which means that East Asians like me would look best with higher-contrast ensembles to go with the yellow skin and black hair. The suit-shirt-tie combo I wore, however, has very little contrast - practically playing between navy and medium blue. The low-contrast problem is exacerbated by the fact that the only color in play was blue - a cool color known for its tranquil, peaceful connotations. While good as a base for combining with other colors and patters, wearing an ensemble with too much blue, especially multiple pieces of similar hues, can function to wash out the wearer’s other features and make him supposedly “fade away.”</p>

<p>So, while my ensemble didn’t necessarily look “bad,” a lighter shirt, or even a patterned one, could have enhanced it. A tie with a bit more contrast - possibly with broader white stripes rather than the less conspicuous dots - would have also done the trick. I did try to add as much contrast as possible with my pocket square by wearing one with a black and white houndstooth, which I thought would provide both pattern and difference in color, but, looking back, a square with slightly more white probably would have worked better.</p>

<p>Blue in all of its shades are great colors for menswear, but be wary of overusing it. Careful management of contrast is necessary to prevent blue ensembles from fading away.</p>

	  <title>The Tieless Suit</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><em>Presidents Xi of China and Obama of the United States met yesterday at the Sunnylands Estate in California. The dress code of the event was “no ties,” to emphasize the casual and friendly nature of the talks, but both leaders still chose to wear conservative solid navy suits and white shirts. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)</em></p>

<p>Wearing a suit without a tie can cause controversy. Proponents of the look call it “executive casual,” referring to the ensembles preferred by company executives who do not need to conform to a dress code, but still wish to look elevated. Critics, however, dub the look “the Ahmadinejad,” referring to the unpopular former Iranian President, whose country forbids the wearing of a tie due to the garment’s implications of Western oppression.</p>

<p>For a long time, I was not a huge fan of wearing a suit without a tie. After all, it makes no sense why anyone would bother putting on matching jackets and trousers if he considers tie as too inconvenient. Aesthetically, though, there’s really no reason why a sport jacket and odd trousers could be worn tieless and a suit cannot. So, lately, I’ve been finding myself doing the exact same thing that I attacked viciously just years ago - putting on a suit, checkered shirt, and a brightly-colored pocket square, but leaving the tie at home.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-wear-ties-anyways">Why Do We Wear Ties Anyways?</h3>
<p>To remove a tie from an ensemble, it is first important to understand the purpose of a necktie. In addition to filling up the space below one’s neck and above the lapel, the necktie also serves to add color, slim the body, and provide so-called “balance” to the ensemble by “tying an ensemble together.”</p>

<p>For example, if I were to wear a navy suit and a white shirt, wearing a tie of another color would reduce the starkness of the contrast between the two colors, making the ensemble more pleasant-looking. Even a navy tie can serve to enhance the ensemble, for it will reduce the amount of white color displayed to reduce the amount of contrast seen.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-the-tie-at-home">Leaving the Tie At Home</h3>

<p>To accomplish the “executive casual” look, one should consider toning down the contrast between suit and shirt to trivialize the tie’s purpose of “tying together an ensemble.” One can do so by wearing a lighter colored suit (e.g. light gray and tan) or wearing a darker-colored and/or patterned shirt (solid white bad!). Also, one should consider choosing a suit with little “tie space” (higher buttoning point) to begin with, such as a more modern two-button or a three-button-roll. Note that though double-breasted and three-button suits tend to have smaller tie spaces, the suits tend to be more formal, and thus unsuitable for executive <em>casual</em>.</p>

<p>Some stylists suggested against the button-down collar for this look because the colloar is inherently casual and not sufficiently <em>executive</em> for “executive casual.” Instead, they would recommend a spread collar, which can stand upright without a tie and has uppity implications.</p>

<p>Stylists also warned against pinstripe suits due to their so-called formality, but I find no basis for their concerns because the pinstripe suit is not <em>formal</em>, but rather <em>for business</em>. Instead, I think the pinstripe suit is perhaps even ideal for this role - the stripes can both add color and serve a slimming and lengthening effect, both of which are usually the role of a tie. I would also add that the charcoal or dark gray suit should be avoided completely - both colors are too boring and too formal for executive casual.</p>

<p>Don’t forget a pocket square for a finishing touch!</p>

	  <title>How Wide Should Ties Be?</title>
	  <link>//how-wide-should-ties-be</link>

	  <guid>//how-wide-should-ties-be</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Some ties can compete with spaghetti strands with respect of width, while other ties look more like napkins. I’ve seen ties from 1 inch to 5 inches. Ties both extremely wide and extremely narrow look comical when worn by common folk, but somehow, there are people who can magically pull it off.</p>

<p>There are two criteria that determine tie width – body width and lapel width. Those wider in the chest should wear wider ties, while those on the skinnier side should keep to narrower ties. This rule keeps one’s body and clothing within proportion.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-thumb">The Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p><img src="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiewidth_v7.png" alt="Tie width diagram" />
<em>Image from BlackLapel.com</em></p>

<p>But, unless you wear only custom-tailored ties, it will be hard to find ties that suits one’s proportions exactly. Instead, the width of a tie is usually chosen to match the lapel – the widest point of the tie should measure about the same as the widest point of the jacket lapel.</p>

<p>3.25 inches is a common width for lapels on recent suits, and 3.5-4 inches is more common for suits made in the 90s and early 2000s. Most ties on the market today around 3 inches in width, while 3.75 inches was considered standard for older ties.</p>

<h3 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h3>
<p><img src="http://blog.trashness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sorley-knit.jpg" alt="Peak Lapel with Knit Tie" />
<em><a href="http://ethandesu.com/post/21772396846/sorley-knit-and-orazio-peaks">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Peak lapels, with “peaks” pointing up towards the shoulders, can generally be worn with ties a bit narrower than its width, because the viewer’s attention is not directed at the tie. With notch lapels, however, one can err towards wider ties (although narrow ties work too). Even so, keep difference in width between lapel and tie within half an inch, if possible. Any larger width difference creates discord and looks extremely absurd.</p>

<p>Lastly, the composition of a tie also matters in tie width. Ties with “interesting” (read “distracting”) patterns and weaves (such as wool knits, silk knits, and grenadines) need less width to “grab attention.” So, ties with intricate designs, either in fabric or in pattern, are allowed to be narrower than the jacket lapels. For the same reason, smoother, non-catchy ties can be slightly wider without causing too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h3>
<p>I used to be very particular in matching the width of jacket lapels and ties -  I even did a bit of sewing work on some particularly wide (~4 in) ties so I could wear them with slimmer suits, but ultimately, it wasn’t worth it. The visual improvement was minimal, since I was an amateur at sewing, I destroyed the lining on some of the ties I “modified,” resulting on them being unwearable.</p>

<p>If your jacket lapels are within an inch of the width of your tie, you’re probably fine.</p>

	  <title>Dimple Your Tie!</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Well, technically, it’s a choice, but really, do dimple your tie.</p>

<p>In ties, a dimple is an indentation of the tie’s fabric formed directly below the knot. It is a common mark of a well-tied tie. The dimple can both complement a symmetrical knot (e.g. half-Windsor, Windsor) and add balance to an asymmetrical knot (e.g. the four-in-hand).</p>

<p>I dimple all my ties. It’s not particularly hard, especially when I use a thicker tie (e.g. wool, silk knits) or one over 3 inches wide. In the last step of forming the knot before tightening, I pinch the side of the tie with my thumb and middle finger while pressing down on the center with my index finger. The dimple forms, as a result, wherever the index finger presses.</p>

<p>Many well-dressed individuals wear their ties with a dimple, but a dimple is by no means a definitive feature of a well-tied tie. A dimple is nice, but it shouldn’t be forced. On skinny ties, a dimple is difficult or impossible to create simply because there isn’t sufficient fabric in the tie to provide for one. Also, dimples are often hard to maintain on thinner, softer fabrics. If you’re wearing one of those ties, and you cannot form a dimple by pressing on the middle of the tie below the knot, don’t “force” it by over-tightening the knot. The dimple is meant to be a natural occurrence, at best created with a little guidance. If your tie really doesn’t want to dimple, it probably was never meant to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>For the same reason, don’t worry too much about the number of dimples or its (their) location(s). Unless you’re using a half-Windsor or Windsor knot, both of which demand centered, symmetrical dimples, the location of the dimple doesn’t really matter. A dimple of any kind will be sufficient to give “balance” to the ensemble.</p>

<p>There are few ties that scream “America” as much as the Brooks Brothers #1 Repp - the first in a series of striped ties that define the essence of Brooks Brothers (and Ivy League) style. The #1 Repp has a series of 5 stripes, alternating in two colors, that run from the top right to the bottom left (the “American way”), widely spaced on a solid background. The <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/BB%231-Repp-Tie/0210,MA02076,default,cp.html?dwvar_A230_Color=BURG&amp;contentpos=39">“original” version</a> is suitable for wear with solid or striped shirts, and the <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Mini-BB%231-Repp-Tie/0210,MA02077,default,cp.html?dwvar_193A_Color=BLCK&amp;contentpos=27">“mini” version</a> may pair better with solids and medium-sized plaids and checks.</p>

<p>Despite it perhaps being best-known as BB #1, the bar stripe tie is by no means exclusive to Brooks Brothers. I’ve seen many clothing companies make their own versions of the BB #1. J Press sells a design very similar to the Mini BB #1 at a similar price range and quality. In fact, President <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/43_George_H.W._Bush_3x4.jpg">George H.W. Bush</a> wore it for his official portrait. Jos. A. Banks calls its version as “Trapped Bar Ties.” Though they retail at a price range similar to that of Brooks, Jos A Banks’ frequent sales makes the tie a suitable lower-quality replacement.</p>

<p>For more fashion-forward individuals, J Crew will occasionally offer similar-looking ties such as this “Triple Stripe” in cotton. For those who spend by the penny, The Tie Bar’s $15 “Bar Stripe” and even some ties offered by Target’s Merona could disguise themselves as the famed BB #1 Repp. I snatched both of mine from the local Goodwill store for $5 each. Since the design of the BB #1 hasn’t changed for years, the ties are indistinguishable from newly-bought ones other than their being a quarter-inch wider at the base.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes; <strong>as long as you wear a four-in-hand, you can wear button-down collar dress shirts with a tie</strong>.</p>

<p>The longer answer gets a bit complicated.</p>

<p>The button-down collar has casual roots – it was originally found on British polo shirts. It was brought back to the United States and placed on button-down shirts by Brooks Brothers. The “Polo Button-Down,” as it was named, was designed to be a sport shirt – the buttons would serve to prevent the collars from flapping when a tie isn’t worn.</p>

<p>The button-down-with-tie look was created a bit after, and was first seen in the early 20th century on Ivy League students. These students wore the then-casual shirt with blazers and striped/emblem ties that represented club membership, and as these men moved on past college, the button-down-with-tie look became an integral part the American workplace.</p>

<p>With that said, it is not hard to see that the button-down-with-tie look would be inappropriate both with more European clothing and in events requiring traditional and more formal attires. Here’s a few instances where it should never be worn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With a black suit. Black suits are too formal for the inherently casual collar. Additionally, American menswear makers do not usually make black suits – a tradition that honors President Abraham Lincoln, who was killed in such a suit.</li>
  <li>With a black tie (unless knit), also due to disagreements in formality.</li>
  <li>To an event demanding “evening informal” or greater formality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are things to avoid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain, solid ties (especially satin). These ties are extremely formal and should only be worn with more formal shirts. Textured solid weaves, such as the grenadine, silk knit, and shantung, are more than acceptable.</li>
  <li>Ties with stripes running from the upper left to lower right (heart to sword). These ties are called “British Stripe.” Many elements of American menswear were made to be complete opposites of British styling, and the two should not mix.</li>
  <li>Any “business formal” event (or more formal) beginning after 6 PM, because such events often demand a step-up in formality (closer to evening informal).</li>
  <li>One-button or double-breasted suits. These garments tend to be more formal, and should be worn with a stiff or otherwise non-buttoned collar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, if the collar on the shirt is too short, it will be unable to “contain” a tie, and is better worn tieless.</p>

<p>Here are things that would look great for the button-down-with-tie look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>American sack suits (J. Press, Brooks Brothers, Jos A Bank), or anything with a center vent</li>
  <li>The “all-American” navy blazer, and its not-all-American cousins</li>
  <li>Tweed (or otherwise rough-textured and/or patterned) sport coats</li>
  <li>American-stripe ties (right to left), repp ties, and foulard ties</li>
  <li>Casual ties: silk knit ties and non-silk ties</li>
  <li>Bowties</li>
</ul>

<p>As I stated before, use a four-in-hand with your button-down collars. This is simply because the collar provides little tie space, and thus a smaller knot should be used. Additionally, the button-down collar should not be ironed flat, but rather curve a little to display a “roll.” A collar’s ability to display this “roll” is often used to judge its quality.</p>

<p>Although the button-down shirt could be difficult to wear with a jacket and tie, it is very comfortable to wear and perhaps the best collar to be worn tieless. Thus, it is definitely reasonable to invest in a few.</p>
