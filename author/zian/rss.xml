	     <p>I first used a fountain pen in second grade, but it was only in late 2015 when I picked it up as a “hobby.” Since then, other than for writing on surfaces that absolutely will not tolerate liquid ink, I have seldom picked up a ballpoint or rollerball ink. In fact, I’ve joined some in the fountain pen online community in calling them “peasant sticks” (jokingly, of course).</p>

<p>So, naturally, I’ve started trying to convert my friends to this hobby – my birthday presents to them have shifted from cookies, ties, and pocket squares to fountain pens, almost exclusively. There are a couple fountain pens that I usually get for first time users.</p>

<p>The pen that I give as presents the most often is the Jinhao X750, a Chinese-made fountain pen. I like it X750 for two main reasons – it is extremely affordable and still look “fancy.” The “Shimmering Sands” design, pictured above, is especially popular because of the subtle silver glitter on the barrel.</p>

<p>Another key appeal of the X750 is its modularity, and not just because of my training as an engineer. Unlike most modern pens, the X750 comes with a converter, which allows the writer to use bottled ink without dishing out extra cash. In addition, it accepts “standard international ink cartridges,” which means that it will be <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/ink-cartridges/c/26/?sortBy=productName%2Basc&amp;facetValueFilter=Tenant~Cartridge_Type%3Astandard-international-long%2CTenant~Cartridge_Type%3Astandard-international-short">easy to find refills</a> for those who favor convenience. Diamine, J. Herbin, Kaweco, Pelikan, and many other ink manufacturers make cartridges that would fit in the X750, meaning that the pen’s user can find a wide variety of color choices without having to subject themselves to the messiness of refilling from a bottle.</p>

<p>Even the pen’s nib is standard and easy to replace – any “#6 nib” would be able to fit into the pen, which allows the user to change the width and style of their writing. This leads me to one of the drawbacks of the pen – the nib that it comes with is a bit flexible and somewhat bold/thick, which means that it might not be suitable for someone who is trying out fountain pens for the first time. Furthermore, the quality control on these pens tends to be variable. Because of this, I almost always replace the nib with a Fine or Extra Fine from Nemosine or Goulet Pens. This is not only an easier “starting point” for new fountain pen users, but will also show that you put in more time to customize the gift for the recipient.</p>

<p>This Jinhao X750 is widely available on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1311.R1.TR5.TRC2.A0.H0.Xjinhao+x750.TRS0&amp;_nkw=jinhao+x750&amp;_sacat=0">eBay</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JinHao-X750-Silver-Fountain-Pen/dp/B00CC76756">Amazon</a> from Chinese sellers for under $5. You can also find the pen on <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/jinhao-x750/c/97">Goulet Pens</a> for slight markup in return for better quality control and, if you’re in the United States, faster delivery. Perhaps somewhat ironic is that replacement nibs will probably run more expensive than the pen itself – <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/goulet-replacement-nibs/c/121">Goulet Pens nibs</a> run for $15, and <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/nemosine-nibs-parts/c/537">Nemosine nibs</a> $10.</p>

<h3 id="second-choice-platinum-preppy-eyedropper-pen-fine-nib">Second Choice: Platinum Preppy Eyedropper Pen, Fine Nib</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/preppy.jpg" alt="Platinum Preppy" title="Platinum Preppy" />
More recently, I’ve started giving out Platinum Preppies, which are plastic, refillable but cheap-enough-to-be-disposable fountain pens from Japan. The chief appeal of this pen to me is its nib – a Japanese firm fine steel nib that reliably produces 0.38mm lines. Beginner fountain pen users tend to have an easier time with these firmer, finer nibs, and the Preppy is probably the cheapest pen you can find with that quality.</p>

<p>Admittedly, though, Platinum Preppies both look and feel cheap – their bodies are plastic, transparent, and covered in writing. However, these pens are in fact incredibly sturdy. Also, I find that people are more likely to use a Preppy than a fancier, metal pen, simply because the former seems less intimidating, thus facilitating smoother learning and transition.</p>

<p>Another good thing about the lack of metal in the pen body is that it can be converted into an “eyedropper,” which means that the entire barrel can be filled with ink if the threading is properly silicone grease-sealed and fitted with an O-ring (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWLfr7TkRFU">many tutorials</a> show how to do this). I estimate that the pen can take around 3mL of ink, which would in turn supply a good 200 pages of writing. I usually eyedropper-convert Preppies before giving them out as gifts – in addition to showing the time and consideration I put into choosing the right ink, the ability to see ink sloshing around in the pen barrel adds novelty to an otherwise plain-seeming pen.</p>

<p>The Platinum Preppy is easy to find online, and usually come with an ink cartridge. You can usually find them in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Platinum-Preppy-Rainbow-Fountain-Point/dp/B00IU3US7O">rainbow-colored 7-packs from Amazon</a> for around $15. <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/platinum-preppy-fountain-pens/c/280">Goulet Pens</a>, <a href="http://www.andersonpens.com/platinum-preppy-pens-s/1895.htm">Anderson Pens</a>, and <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pens/ct/371">JetPens</a> also sell these pens individually, where they run for around $3-4 each.</p>

<p>According to the fountain pen subreddit and many other online resources, the Pilot Metropolitan tends to be the first fountain pen that beginners buy to get into the habit. In some ways, the pen combines the best qualities of the Jinhao X750 and the Platinum Preppy – it has both an aesthetically appealing metal body and a reliable firm nib (~0.38mm for fine, ~0.5mm for medium). In other ways, it’s pretty much perfect out of the box.</p>

<p>Why, then, isn’t the Pilot Metropolitan number one on my list? I find that it’s a bit generic for a gift, and the only way you can really “customize” it is to pair it with ink samplers. So, I’d rather have this pen be the first that my friends would later purchase for themselves after becoming more involved in the hobby rather than gifting it to them.</p>

<p>The Pilot Metropolitan can be found online (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Collection-Fountain-91111/dp/B00KRPFD96/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480137789&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pilot+metropolitan">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706">JetPens</a>, <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-metropolitan/c/191">Goulet Pens</a>, <a href="http://www.andersonpens.com/pilot-metropolitan-pens-s/1888.htm?searching=Y&amp;sort=7&amp;cat=1888&amp;show=15&amp;page=1&amp;f-Fountain%20Pen=2448">Anderson Pens</a>), and usually sells for $15 for the pen, a cartridge, and a converter. However, if you’re looking to use bottled ink, I suggest buying a twist converter (CON-50 or CON-70), which will add a couple more bucks to the total price.</p>

<h3 id="other-good-choices">Other Good Choices</h3>
<p>Besides the Jinhao X750, Platinum Preppy, and Pilot Metropolitan, there are definitely more pens that you can buy for friends that you want to bring into the fountain pen hobby. For instance, the <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/jinhao-159/c/92">Jinhao 159</a> is very similar to the X750, and as a “tribute” to the <a href="http://www.montblanc.com/en-us/collection/writing-instruments/meisterstueck/115064-meisterstueck-platinum-line-149-fountain-pen.html">Montblanc Meisterstück 149</a>, it looks even more fancy-looking. The Lamy fountain pens are popular alternatives to Pilot Metropolitans, and the brand’s <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/lamy-safari/c/159">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/lamy-vista/c/168">Vista</a>, and <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/lamy-al-star/c/154">Al-Star</a> models have triangular grip that show beginner users how to hold their pens in the correct orientation. I, however, never saw the appeal. My handwriting slants to the right, which means that I hold my pens at a different angle. The triangular grip, thus, disrupts my writing more than it helps.</p>

<p>Friends don’t let friends use peasant pens – what pens do you give your friends to start them on the hobby?</p>

	  <title>Is There Such a Thing As Too Much Blue?</title>
	  <link>//toomuchblue</link>
	  <author>Zian Liu</author>
	  <pubDate>2016-11-21T14:06:00-08:00</pubDate>
	  <guid>//toomuchblue</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I love the color blue - it’s probably my favorite - and I wear it a lot. I own three solid navy suits and three solid navy sportcoats, most of my dress shirts are in shades of blue or are white with blue patterns, a majority of my ties are blue, and of course I have plenty of blue other accessories. Blue is an easy color to incorporate into any business/classic menswear ensemble, but the ensemble I wore to a departmental banquet tonight got me thinking about whether there’s such a thing as “too much blue.”</p>

<p><img src="https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LU083_1218ac_GR_20151218152241.jpg" alt="President Barack Obama" title="Obama in Tonal Ensemble" /></p>

<p>My ensemble wasn’t all that uncommon - navy suit, medium blue shirt, and navy dotted tie. In fact, President Obama has been wearing darker shirts in his blue-on-blue ensembles recently, creating an overall “tonal” look, but this doesn’t seem to work quite as well on me. I subscribe to the Alan Flusser’s school of thought that the contrast within a person’s clothing should seek to complement their natural contrast, which means that East Asians like me would look best with higher-contrast ensembles to go with the yellow skin and black hair. The suit-shirt-tie combo I wore, however, has very little contrast - practically playing between navy and medium blue. The low-contrast problem is exacerbated by the fact that the only color in play was blue - a cool color known for its tranquil, peaceful connotations. While good as a base for combining with other colors and patters, wearing an ensemble with too much blue, especially multiple pieces of similar hues, can function to wash out the wearer’s other features and make him supposedly “fade away.”</p>

<p>So, while my ensemble didn’t necessarily look “bad,” a lighter shirt, or even a patterned one, could have enhanced it. A tie with a bit more contrast - possibly with broader white stripes rather than the less conspicuous dots - would have also done the trick. I did try to add as much contrast as possible with my pocket square by wearing one with a black and white houndstooth, which I thought would provide both pattern and difference in color, but, looking back, a square with slightly more white probably would have worked better.</p>

<p>Blue in all of its shades are great colors for menswear, but be wary of overusing it. Careful management of contrast is necessary to prevent blue ensembles from fading away.</p>

	  <title>Fountain Pen Highlighters</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Recently I bought myself some <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/platinum-preppy-highlighters/c/288">Platinum Preppy highlighters</a>. Instead of using the free ink cartridges that came with the pen, I eyedroppered them with the matching <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/bottled-ink/c/14/?sortBy=productName%2Basc&amp;facetValueFilter=Tenant~Brand%3Anoodlers%2CTenant~Ink_Color%3Ahighlighter">highlighter inks from Noodlers</a>.</p>

<p>Pretty much, these pens are a hybrid of markers and fountain pens, since it sports the latter’s capillary action ink mechanism and the former’s easy-to-use tip. Filled with water-based yet fluorescent ink, it works quite well, easily drawing emphasis on written documents upon every streak.</p>

<p>The drawback of these highlighters, however, is that it’s quite “wet,” and that the ink can sometimes take awhile to dry atop the page. These properties, desired by users of fountain pens, might not be as useful for highlighters. I’ve had many instances where a too-slow stream with the highlighter not only bled through the back of a page, but stayed on the page long enough to stain the back of the previous page too.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m satisfied with the Platinum Preppy highlighter. Fountain pen fans should consider getting one to complete their entire fountain pen experience!</p>

	  <title>Keynote Address at Tau Beta Pi Candidate Meeting</title>
	  <link>//cm</link>
	  <author>Zian Liu</author>
	  <pubDate>2016-09-22T13:06:00-07:00</pubDate>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><em>As prepared for delivery.</em></p>

<p>I’m Zane, and I’m a Master’s Candidate in the Translational Medicine program joint between UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. As an undergrad here and even now as a grad student, I’ve been really involved in Tau Beta Pi, and I’m here to answer the question, “why am I still here?”</p>

<p>Just three years ago, I was one of you, attending Candidate Meeting, just one floor up from here in the Woz. I joined TBP at the time because, as I suspect for the same reason many of you are here, I wanted it on my resume, and because I decided that the CM food was good and I wanted more.</p>

<p>But ultimately, it wasn’t the prestige or the food that kept me in TBP. I stayed in TBP because, in part, it no longer stood for “Tau Beta Pi” to me; it stood for “the best people,” and I’ll tell you three reasons why.</p>

<p>The first reason I call TBP “the best people” is that it’s where I found my mentors, and this is an especially surprising statement for me because my interests are very unique – I was a bioengineer who also liked public policy. But you see – Tau Beta Pi is made up of top students from all disciplines engineering and has over 100 years’ worth of alumni who were once those students. So, it’s pretty likely that you can find someone who’s done what you want to do, and could get you where you want to be, even if you’re a special snowflake like me.</p>

<p>The second reason TBP is “the best people” is that in addition to being mentors, they can also be your references for your next job. I’m learning this after sixteen long years in school and finally starting to look for jobs in the real world. In the job market of today, referrals from an employee might make the difference between getting overlooked or landing an interview. As it turns out, TBP alums can be found in every company you’ll probably consider applying to, and they’re more than happy to help you out.</p>

<p>The third reason TBP means “the best people” is that in this club, I found lifelong friends. During Veteran’s Day last year, two weeks before my senior project and first set of grad apps were due, I came down with pneumonia. Since I’m a serial procrastinator, I obviously hadn’t worked on my apps, and I tried to convince myself that despite my 104 degree fever, I was fine, and should work on my personal statements. It was a friend that I was only able to meet through TBP who took care of me, offered to bring me soup, and made me stop working and go to the hospital and get diagnosed, treated, and ultimately cured. She’s the reason I’m not only standing before you here tonight as a graduate student in one of the most prestigious translational medicine programs in the world, but also the reason I can stand before you at all.</p>

<p>TBP means “the best people” to me, and clearly, I found value in Tau Beta Pi.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re here, then you’ve been recognized as one of the best engineers in one of the finest universities in the world. All of you will succeed, regardless of whether you have the line “Tau Beta Pi” on your resume, but I encourage you to come and explore what TBP has to offer you.</p>

<p>This is where I found my mentors.</p>

<p>This is where I found my references.</p>

<p>This is where I found my closest friends.</p>

<p>I’ll be around after, hopefully somewhere in the front of the food line outside, if you have any questions about what I just said. You’ll also find me at as many free food events this semester as I could make, and I hope that I’ll meet each and every one of you there.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

	     <p>When I was President of the Bioengineering Honor Society, I remember wishing for the power to “reshuffle cabinet.” This is a common practice amongst heads of government, such as prime ministers in parliamentary democracies and the President of the United States.</p>

<p>The idea is simple – the President or PM has the power to assign people in his cabinet to new official positions. This could be used to promote political allies or demote political rivals (which is probably the most common reason for reshuffles), or simply to optimize the governmental utility, putting the people with the most expertise or interest in each area in the positions that have influence on them. In a student group, this can work similarly – the President, or some constitutionally determined “executive,” can “move” officers around between positions. This can be appealing for two reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that new club members don’t always run for and get truly fitting positions; as these new officers get to know the club more, they may discover other roles which are more “appropriate” for their interests and talents, and a cabinet reshuffle allows them to enter that more appropriate portfolio instead of being “stuck” in their current one, without having to wait months for another election.</p>

<p>The second reason has to do with time – many officers discover halfway through their term that they are too busy with their schoolwork to perform their expected tasks. A cabinet reshuffle, in this case, can allow busy officers and less-busy officers to swap positions, allowing both to remain a part of the club while allowing work to get done.</p>

<p>There are, of course, counterarguments to implementing reshuffling. While promotions from favoritism may be a concern, I argue that it will likely be less prevalent than in government. Being offered some club title and, in conjunction, all the responsibilities associated with it, is not nearly as attractive as being offered the position of being third-in-line to the Presidency, and the social backlash will be high.</p>

<p>Another potential drawback of reshuffling is that members may not be as willing to become an officer if they don’t have the guarantee of being able to stay. Admittedly, some people are more driven by a position profile than the club when they run to be an officer (e.g. running to be an industrial relations position to get recruiter contacts, without much regard for the actual club). However, if an officer were so interested in their work, they should do well in it, and thus not need to be “reshuffled” to another position. So, this concern should be minimal as well.</p>

<p>Student clubs need flexibility among their personnel. More clubs should consider allowing their officers to move around – through cabinet reshuffles.</p>

	  <title>The Tieless Suit</title>

	     <p><em>Presidents Xi of China and Obama of the United States met yesterday at the Sunnylands Estate in California. The dress code of the event was “no ties,” to emphasize the casual and friendly nature of the talks, but both leaders still chose to wear conservative solid navy suits and white shirts.

<p>Wearing a suit without a tie can cause controversy. Proponents of the look call it “executive casual,” referring to the ensembles preferred by company executives who do not need to conform to a dress code, but still wish to look elevated. Critics, however, dub the look “the Ahmadinejad,” referring to the unpopular former Iranian President, whose country forbids the wearing of a tie due to the garment’s implications of Western oppression.</p>

<p>For a long time, I was not a huge fan of wearing a suit without a tie. After all, it makes no sense why anyone would bother putting on matching jackets and trousers if he considers tie as too inconvenient. Aesthetically, though, there’s really no reason why a sport jacket and odd trousers could be worn tieless and a suit cannot. So, lately, I’ve been finding myself doing the exact same thing that I attacked viciously just years ago - putting on a suit, checkered shirt, and a brightly-colored pocket square, but leaving the tie at home.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-wear-ties-anyways">Why Do We Wear Ties Anyways?</h3>
<p>To remove a tie from an ensemble, it is first important to understand the purpose of a necktie. In addition to filling up the space below one’s neck and above the lapel, the necktie also serves to add color, slim the body, and provide so-called “balance” to the ensemble by “tying an ensemble together.”</p>

<p>For example, if I were to wear a navy suit and a white shirt, wearing a tie of another color would reduce the starkness of the contrast between the two colors, making the ensemble more pleasant-looking. Even a navy tie can serve to enhance the ensemble, for it will reduce the amount of white color displayed to reduce the amount of contrast seen.</p>

<p>To accomplish the “executive casual” look, one should consider toning down the contrast between suit and shirt to trivialize the tie’s purpose of “tying together an ensemble.” One can do so by wearing a lighter colored suit (e.g. light gray and tan) or wearing a darker-colored and/or patterned shirt (solid white bad!). Also, one should consider choosing a suit with little “tie space” (higher buttoning point) to begin with, such as a more modern two-button or a three-button-roll. Note that though double-breasted and three-button suits tend to have smaller tie spaces, the suits tend to be more formal, and thus unsuitable for executive <em>casual</em>.</p>

<p>Some stylists suggested against the button-down collar for this look because the colloar is inherently casual and not sufficiently <em>executive</em> for “executive casual.” Instead, they would recommend a spread collar, which can stand upright without a tie and has uppity implications.</p>

<p>Stylists also warned against pinstripe suits due to their so-called formality, but I find no basis for their concerns because the pinstripe suit is not <em>formal</em>, but rather <em>for business</em>. Instead, I think the pinstripe suit is perhaps even ideal for this role - the stripes can both add color and serve a slimming and lengthening effect, both of which are usually the role of a tie. I would also add that the charcoal or dark gray suit should be avoided completely - both colors are too boring and too formal for executive casual.</p>

<p>Don’t forget a pocket square for a finishing touch!</p>

	  <title>How Wide Should Ties Be?</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Some ties can compete with spaghetti strands with respect of width, while other ties look more like napkins. I’ve seen ties from 1 inch to 5 inches. Ties both extremely wide and extremely narrow look comical when worn by common folk, but somehow, there are people who can magically pull it off.</p>

<p>There are two criteria that determine tie width – body width and lapel width. Those wider in the chest should wear wider ties, while those on the skinnier side should keep to narrower ties. This rule keeps one’s body and clothing within proportion.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-thumb">The Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p><img src="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiewidth_v7.png" alt="Tie width diagram" />
<em>Image from BlackLapel.com</em></p>

<p>But, unless you wear only custom-tailored ties, it will be hard to find ties that suits one’s proportions exactly. Instead, the width of a tie is usually chosen to match the lapel – the widest point of the tie should measure about the same as the widest point of the jacket lapel.</p>

<p>3.25 inches is a common width for lapels on recent suits, and 3.5-4 inches is more common for suits made in the 90s and early 2000s. Most ties on the market today around 3 inches in width, while 3.75 inches was considered standard for older ties.</p>

<h3 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h3>
<p><img src="http://blog.trashness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sorley-knit.jpg" alt="Peak Lapel with Knit Tie" />
<em><a href="http://ethandesu.com/post/21772396846/sorley-knit-and-orazio-peaks">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Peak lapels, with “peaks” pointing up towards the shoulders, can generally be worn with ties a bit narrower than its width, because the viewer’s attention is not directed at the tie. With notch lapels, however, one can err towards wider ties (although narrow ties work too). Even so, keep difference in width between lapel and tie within half an inch, if possible. Any larger width difference creates discord and looks extremely absurd.</p>

<p>Lastly, the composition of a tie also matters in tie width. Ties with “interesting” (read “distracting”) patterns and weaves (such as wool knits, silk knits, and grenadines) need less width to “grab attention.” So, ties with intricate designs, either in fabric or in pattern, are allowed to be narrower than the jacket lapels. For the same reason, smoother, non-catchy ties can be slightly wider without causing too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h3>
<p>I used to be very particular in matching the width of jacket lapels and ties -  I even did a bit of sewing work on some particularly wide (~4 in) ties so I could wear them with slimmer suits, but ultimately, it wasn’t worth it. The visual improvement was minimal, since I was an amateur at sewing, I destroyed the lining on some of the ties I “modified,” resulting on them being unwearable.</p>

<p>If your jacket lapels are within an inch of the width of your tie, you’re probably fine.</p>

<p>A bottle of <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-iroshizuku-kon-peki-50ml-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/PN69212">Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-Peki</a> ink arrived for me today, and I had a friend buy me a bottle of <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/pilot-iroshizuku-yama-budo-50ml-bottled-fountain-pen-ink/p/PN69217">Yama-budo</a> from Japan, which I’ll get soon.</p>

<p>Pilot Iroshizuku inks sell at $35 for a 50mL bottle. The inks come in unique colors and “behave reliably” on many different papers. The bottle itself is intricately designed, with a “well” on the bottom that would fit a fountain pen, allowing the user to refill a pen from even the last drops of ink.</p>

<p>Though I didn’t pay retail price, the fact that I’m moving into this “luxury” category is nonetheless noteworthy. Just a few years ago, when I received a fountain pen as a high school graduation present, I shook my head at ink selections over $10. Back then, even seven dollars for a bottle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PARKER-Super-Quink-Bottle-S0037460/dp/B004YK4VHA">Parker Quink Black</a>, the cheapest fountain pen ink I could find, felt like too much to pay for stationary, and now I’m willing to pay multiple times as much.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is indicative of something, and I really need to find something less expensive to like…</p>

	  <title>Dimple Your Tie!</title>
	  <link>//dimple-your-tie</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Well, technically, it’s a choice, but really, do dimple your tie.</p>

<p>In ties, a dimple is an indentation of the tie’s fabric formed directly below the knot. It is a common mark of a well-tied tie. The dimple can both complement a symmetrical knot (e.g. half-Windsor, Windsor) and add balance to an asymmetrical knot (e.g. the four-in-hand).</p>

<p>I dimple all my ties. It’s not particularly hard, especially when I use a thicker tie (e.g. wool, silk knits) or one over 3 inches wide. In the last step of forming the knot before tightening, I pinch the side of the tie with my thumb and middle finger while pressing down on the center with my index finger. The dimple forms, as a result, wherever the index finger presses.</p>

<p>Many well-dressed individuals wear their ties with a dimple, but a dimple is by no means a definitive feature of a well-tied tie. A dimple is nice, but it shouldn’t be forced. On skinny ties, a dimple is difficult or impossible to create simply because there isn’t sufficient fabric in the tie to provide for one. Also, dimples are often hard to maintain on thinner, softer fabrics. If you’re wearing one of those ties, and you cannot form a dimple by pressing on the middle of the tie below the knot, don’t “force” it by over-tightening the knot. The dimple is meant to be a natural occurrence, at best created with a little guidance. If your tie really doesn’t want to dimple, it probably was never meant to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>For the same reason, don’t worry too much about the number of dimples or its (their) location(s). Unless you’re using a half-Windsor or Windsor knot, both of which demand centered, symmetrical dimples, the location of the dimple doesn’t really matter. A dimple of any kind will be sufficient to give “balance” to the ensemble.</p>
