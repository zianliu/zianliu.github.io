<em>Presidents Xi of China and Obama of the United States met yesterday at the Sunnylands Estate in California. The dress code of the event was “no ties,” to emphasize the casual and friendly nature of the talks, but both leaders still chose to wear conservative solid navy suits and white shirts.

<p>Wearing a suit without a tie can cause controversy. Proponents of the look call it “executive casual,” referring to the ensembles preferred by company executives who do not need to conform to a dress code, but still wish to look elevated. Critics, however, dub the look “the Ahmadinejad,” referring to the unpopular former Iranian President, whose country forbids the wearing of a tie due to the garment’s implications of Western oppression.</p>

<p>For a long time, I was not a huge fan of wearing a suit without a tie. After all, it makes no sense why anyone would bother putting on matching jackets and trousers if he considers tie as too inconvenient. Aesthetically, though, there’s really no reason why a sport jacket and odd trousers could be worn tieless and a suit cannot. So, lately, I’ve been finding myself doing the exact same thing that I attacked viciously just years ago - putting on a suit, checkered shirt, and a brightly-colored pocket square, but leaving the tie at home.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-wear-ties-anyways">Why Do We Wear Ties Anyways?</h3>
<p>To remove a tie from an ensemble, it is first important to understand the purpose of a necktie. In addition to filling up the space below one’s neck and above the lapel, the necktie also serves to add color, slim the body, and provide so-called “balance” to the ensemble by “tying an ensemble together.”</p>

<p>For example, if I were to wear a navy suit and a white shirt, wearing a tie of another color would reduce the starkness of the contrast between the two colors, making the ensemble more pleasant-looking. Even a navy tie can serve to enhance the ensemble, for it will reduce the amount of white color displayed to reduce the amount of contrast seen.</p>

<p>To accomplish the “executive casual” look, one should consider toning down the contrast between suit and shirt to trivialize the tie’s purpose of “tying together an ensemble.” One can do so by wearing a lighter colored suit (e.g. light gray and tan) or wearing a darker-colored and/or patterned shirt (solid white bad!). Also, one should consider choosing a suit with little “tie space” (higher buttoning point) to begin with, such as a more modern two-button or a three-button-roll. Note that though double-breasted and three-button suits tend to have smaller tie spaces, the suits tend to be more formal, and thus unsuitable for executive <em>casual</em>.</p>

<p>Some stylists suggested against the button-down collar for this look because the colloar is inherently casual and not sufficiently <em>executive</em> for “executive casual.” Instead, they would recommend a spread collar, which can stand upright without a tie and has uppity implications.</p>

<p>Stylists also warned against pinstripe suits due to their so-called formality, but I find no basis for their concerns because the pinstripe suit is not <em>formal</em>, but rather <em>for business</em>. Instead, I think the pinstripe suit is perhaps even ideal for this role - the stripes can both add color and serve a slimming and lengthening effect, both of which are usually the role of a tie. I would also add that the charcoal or dark gray suit should be avoided completely - both colors are too boring and too formal for executive casual.</p>

<p>Don’t forget a pocket square for a finishing touch!</p>

	  <title>How Wide Should Ties Be?</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Some ties can compete with spaghetti strands with respect of width, while other ties look more like napkins. I’ve seen ties from 1 inch to 5 inches. Ties both extremely wide and extremely narrow look comical when worn by common folk, but somehow, there are people who can magically pull it off.</p>

<p>There are two criteria that determine tie width – body width and lapel width. Those wider in the chest should wear wider ties, while those on the skinnier side should keep to narrower ties. This rule keeps one’s body and clothing within proportion.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-thumb">The Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p><img src="https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiewidth_v7.png" alt="Tie width diagram" />
<em>Image from BlackLapel.com</em></p>

<p>But, unless you wear only custom-tailored ties, it will be hard to find ties that suits one’s proportions exactly. Instead, the width of a tie is usually chosen to match the lapel – the widest point of the tie should measure about the same as the widest point of the jacket lapel.</p>

<p>3.25 inches is a common width for lapels on recent suits, and 3.5-4 inches is more common for suits made in the 90s and early 2000s. Most ties on the market today around 3 inches in width, while 3.75 inches was considered standard for older ties.</p>

<h3 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h3>
<p><img src="http://blog.trashness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sorley-knit.jpg" alt="Peak Lapel with Knit Tie" />
<em><a href="http://ethandesu.com/post/21772396846/sorley-knit-and-orazio-peaks">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Peak lapels, with “peaks” pointing up towards the shoulders, can generally be worn with ties a bit narrower than its width, because the viewer’s attention is not directed at the tie. With notch lapels, however, one can err towards wider ties (although narrow ties work too). Even so, keep difference in width between lapel and tie within half an inch, if possible. Any larger width difference creates discord and looks extremely absurd.</p>

<p>Lastly, the composition of a tie also matters in tie width. Ties with “interesting” (read “distracting”) patterns and weaves (such as wool knits, silk knits, and grenadines) need less width to “grab attention.” So, ties with intricate designs, either in fabric or in pattern, are allowed to be narrower than the jacket lapels. For the same reason, smoother, non-catchy ties can be slightly wider without causing too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h3>
<p>I used to be very particular in matching the width of jacket lapels and ties -  I even did a bit of sewing work on some particularly wide (~4 in) ties so I could wear them with slimmer suits, but ultimately, it wasn’t worth it. The visual improvement was minimal, since I was an amateur at sewing, I destroyed the lining on some of the ties I “modified,” resulting on them being unwearable.</p>

<p>If your jacket lapels are within an inch of the width of your tie, you’re probably fine.</p>

	  <title>Dimple Your Tie!</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Well, technically, it’s a choice, but really, do dimple your tie.</p>

<p>In ties, a dimple is an indentation of the tie’s fabric formed directly below the knot. It is a common mark of a well-tied tie. The dimple can both complement a symmetrical knot (e.g. half-Windsor, Windsor) and add balance to an asymmetrical knot (e.g. the four-in-hand).</p>

<p>I dimple all my ties. It’s not particularly hard, especially when I use a thicker tie (e.g. wool, silk knits) or one over 3 inches wide. In the last step of forming the knot before tightening, I pinch the side of the tie with my thumb and middle finger while pressing down on the center with my index finger. The dimple forms, as a result, wherever the index finger presses.</p>

<p>Many well-dressed individuals wear their ties with a dimple, but a dimple is by no means a definitive feature of a well-tied tie. A dimple is nice, but it shouldn’t be forced. On skinny ties, a dimple is difficult or impossible to create simply because there isn’t sufficient fabric in the tie to provide for one. Also, dimples are often hard to maintain on thinner, softer fabrics. If you’re wearing one of those ties, and you cannot form a dimple by pressing on the middle of the tie below the knot, don’t “force” it by over-tightening the knot. The dimple is meant to be a natural occurrence, at best created with a little guidance. If your tie really doesn’t want to dimple, it probably was never meant to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>For the same reason, don’t worry too much about the number of dimples or its (their) location(s). Unless you’re using a half-Windsor or Windsor knot, both of which demand centered, symmetrical dimples, the location of the dimple doesn’t really matter. A dimple of any kind will be sufficient to give “balance” to the ensemble.</p>

	  <title>My First Fountain Pen</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Sometime in elementary school (for me, it was second grade), every Chinese kid would need to switch from writing with pencil to writing with a fountain pen - in every class. In addition to teaching us to write neatly, writing with a fountain pen was supposed to instill in us the value of doing things correctly the first time around. After all, ink, unlike graphite, was permanent, and showed our mistakes. So, if crossed-out sections or evidence of mysteriously ripped-out pages were found in our noteboks, we would be called up to the front of the class and berated for all to see.</p>

<p>Like any other eight-year-old having barely two years of handwriting experience, I dreaded writing with a fountain pen. Unlike the tip of a pencil, which writes in all directions, the fountain pen’s nib only put down ink properly at one angle. Furthermore, clumsy as I was, every night’s pen-refilling ritual left my hands dyed in blue. So, when we were given the opportunity to begin using gel pens (liquid ink, writes in all directions) halfway through third grade, I eagerly made the switch. I never thought I would ever voluntarily pick up a fountain pen again.</p>

<p>So, finding my old fountain pen from elementary schook during my trip to China was an strange yet interesting experience. I’m sure that eight-year-old Zian would never have imagined that thirteen years later, he had somehow become a fountain pen enthusiast, and own way too many bottles of ink and an unreasonable number of pens, but still feeling that he needed more. There was also a sense of nostalgia - coming back after finishing college and at the verge of graduate school, and seeing the equipment that helped me begin my academic journey all those years ago.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the child-sized pen no longer feels comfortable in my hands, and years of disuse has left it clogged with ink. Like many Hero fountain pens made in that era, it also now has a cracked section, which is now unable to attach to the barrel, and the cap no longer closes tightly.</p>

<p>But let it, in its own, particular way, serve as a memento for reflection and introspection for years to come.</p>

	     <p>My undergraduate biodesign team, Team ForSight, was invited to participate in the <a href="http://www.rice360.rice.edu/#!design-competition/wv2xp">Rice 360° Sixth Annual Undergraduate Global Health Technologies Design Competition</a>. My team mates, Amanda and Ian, and I presented our design for a drug-eluting contact lens targeted for use in developing countries, to deliver antifungal drug natamycin to treat corneal ulcers.</p>

<p>There, we also received feedback from industry and clinical experts on ways to improve our product design to increase its usability both in a developing world setting.</p>

<p>Here is an abstract of our presentation to Rice 360:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corneal ulceration is a leading cause of preventable blindness in the developing world, where the cost of treatment and the lack of accessible medical facilities pose barriers to administering care.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have designed a proof-of-concept prototype for a novel drug eluting contact lens, which delivers drugs directly to the cornea. The design consists of a layer of PDMS, a soft, biocompatible polymer, to keep the contact’s shape, and a layer of biodegradable PLGA, which contains the drug in suspension.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using natamycin, the only FDA-approved ocular antifungal drug, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our contact design to clear yeast in agar diffusion tests. We also showed that our degradation design delivers drug more efficiently and in a more sustained fashion than both eyedrops and a diffusion limited model. Our contact lens prototype provides a proof of concept for a low-cost, easy-to-use ocular drug delivery device.</p>

	     <p>By the invitation of <a href="http://www.miis.edu/academics/faculty/rzilinskas">Dr. Ray Zilinskas</a>, I spoke at a departmental seminar at the <a href="http://www.miis.edu/">Middlebury Institute of International Studies</a> today, where I presented my research on the impacts of recent technological advances on the biosecurity landscape. I was the first undergraduate to ever be invited and to speak at such a seminar at MIIS, a graduate-only institution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scholars claim that recent technology advances mean that even teenagers can make bioweapons. While this is theoretically possible, it is also very unlikely. Mr. Liu presents a plausible pathway for amateur biohackers to engineer a weapon and assess the difficulty of every step. Furthermore, he comments on how improvements in DNA editing may alter the biosecurity landscape.</p>

<p>There are few ties that scream “America” as much as the Brooks Brothers #1 Repp - the first in a series of striped ties that define the essence of Brooks Brothers (and Ivy League) style. The #1 Repp has a series of 5 stripes, alternating in two colors, that run from the top right to the bottom left (the “American way”), widely spaced on a solid background. The <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/BB%231-Repp-Tie/0210,MA02076,default,cp.html?dwvar_A230_Color=BURG&amp;contentpos=39">“original” version</a> is suitable for wear with solid or striped shirts, and the <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Mini-BB%231-Repp-Tie/0210,MA02077,default,cp.html?dwvar_193A_Color=BLCK&amp;contentpos=27">“mini” version</a> may pair better with solids and medium-sized plaids and checks.</p>

<p>Despite it perhaps being best-known as BB #1, the bar stripe tie is by no means exclusive to Brooks Brothers. I’ve seen many clothing companies make their own versions of the BB #1. J Press sells a design very similar to the Mini BB #1 at a similar price range and quality. In fact, President <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/43_George_H.W._Bush_3x4.jpg">George H.W. Bush</a> wore it for his official portrait. Jos. A. Banks calls its version as “Trapped Bar Ties.” Though they retail at a price range similar to that of Brooks, Jos A Banks’ frequent sales makes the tie a suitable lower-quality replacement.</p>

<p>For more fashion-forward individuals, J Crew will occasionally offer similar-looking ties such as this “Triple Stripe” in cotton. For those who spend by the penny, The Tie Bar’s $15 “Bar Stripe” and even some ties offered by Target’s Merona could disguise themselves as the famed BB #1 Repp. I snatched both of mine from the local Goodwill store for $5 each. Since the design of the BB #1 hasn’t changed for years, the ties are indistinguishable from newly-bought ones other than their being a quarter-inch wider at the base.</p>

<script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

<p>The short answer is yes; <strong>as long as you wear a four-in-hand, you can wear button-down collar dress shirts with a tie</strong>.</p>

<p>The longer answer gets a bit complicated.</p>

<p>The button-down collar has casual roots – it was originally found on British polo shirts. It was brought back to the United States and placed on button-down shirts by Brooks Brothers. The “Polo Button-Down,” as it was named, was designed to be a sport shirt – the buttons would serve to prevent the collars from flapping when a tie isn’t worn.</p>

<p>The button-down-with-tie look was created a bit after, and was first seen in the early 20th century on Ivy League students. These students wore the then-casual shirt with blazers and striped/emblem ties that represented club membership, and as these men moved on past college, the button-down-with-tie look became an integral part the American workplace.</p>

<p>With that said, it is not hard to see that the button-down-with-tie look would be inappropriate both with more European clothing and in events requiring traditional and more formal attires. Here’s a few instances where it should never be worn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>With a black suit. Black suits are too formal for the inherently casual collar. Additionally, American menswear makers do not usually make black suits – a tradition that honors President Abraham Lincoln, who was killed in such a suit.</li>
  <li>With a black tie (unless knit), also due to disagreements in formality.</li>
  <li>To an event demanding “evening informal” or greater formality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are things to avoid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain, solid ties (especially satin). These ties are extremely formal and should only be worn with more formal shirts. Textured solid weaves, such as the grenadine, silk knit, and shantung, are more than acceptable.</li>
  <li>Ties with stripes running from the upper left to lower right (heart to sword). These ties are called “British Stripe.” Many elements of American menswear were made to be complete opposites of British styling, and the two should not mix.</li>
  <li>Any “business formal” event (or more formal) beginning after 6 PM, because such events often demand a step-up in formality (closer to evening informal).</li>
  <li>One-button or double-breasted suits. These garments tend to be more formal, and should be worn with a stiff or otherwise non-buttoned collar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, if the collar on the shirt is too short, it will be unable to “contain” a tie, and is better worn tieless.</p>

<p>Here are things that would look great for the button-down-with-tie look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>American sack suits (J. Press, Brooks Brothers, Jos A Bank), or anything with a center vent</li>
  <li>The “all-American” navy blazer, and its not-all-American cousins</li>
  <li>Tweed (or otherwise rough-textured and/or patterned) sport coats</li>
  <li>American-stripe ties (right to left), repp ties, and foulard ties</li>
  <li>Casual ties: silk knit ties and non-silk ties</li>
  <li>Bowties</li>
</ul>

<p>As I stated before, use a four-in-hand with your button-down collars. This is simply because the collar provides little tie space, and thus a smaller knot should be used. Additionally, the button-down collar should not be ironed flat, but rather curve a little to display a “roll.” A collar’s ability to display this “roll” is often used to judge its quality.</p>

<p>Although the button-down shirt could be difficult to wear with a jacket and tie, it is very comfortable to wear and perhaps the best collar to be worn tieless. Thus, it is definitely reasonable to invest in a few.</p>

	     <p>I am honored and humbled to assume the Office of President of the Bioengineering Honor Society. For myself and on behalf of this club, I want to thank my predecessor for all she has done.</p>

<p>I want to recognize Anita for her role in the leadership, because she, not I, should have been the one becoming president today. Anita, you’ve given so much to this club - joy in a year as Social Chair and direction in a semester as EVP. We relied on you for each and every important project - two DWPs, the high school competition, a plethora of workshops, and countless socials. Your enthusiasm, your dependability, your natural and proven leadership - all these qualities made you the rock and backbone of BioEHS in this difficult time. I hope to be a worthy replacement of the great president you surely would have been.</p>

<p>For all of BioEHS - alumni, officers, members old and new - I want to apologize if this club has not lived up to your expectations. BioEHS needs to change after a year of stagnation, and it is the responsibility of this officer core to give the club the activation energy needed to revive it.</p>

<p>For we must make candidacy worthwhile to those who wish to join us, we must make membership meaningful for those who are a part of us, and we must make our actions useful for those around us.</p>

<p>My fellow bioengineers, fellow members of the Bioengineering Honor Society - the era of stagnation is over. Because today, the work to build a better BioEHS begins, and I hope to see all of you on the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Thank you, and good night!</p>
